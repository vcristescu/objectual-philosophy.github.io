<H2><SPAN lang="FR">Why philosophy&nbsp;?</SPAN></H2>
<p><SPAN lang="FR">Among the set of the definitions given by the   Romanian dictionaries and</SPAN> encyclopaedias for defining the <em>philosophy</em> term, the most adequate one,   when it comes to the desired meaning, is the following phrase: &ldquo;&hellip;.we must note   that many of the problems implied by the philosophy as an intellectual subject   matter are relevant for philosophy, in one way or another, as a vision on the   world.&rdquo; This quote is taken from the foreword to The Dictionary of Philosophy   and Logics written by Anthony Flew, &ldquo;Humanitas&rdquo; Publishing-House, 1996. The last   words have a special meaning for us: <em>philosophy as a vision on the world</em>.   Indeed, a specific philosophy means a <U>certain vision on the world</U>. For   the mankind, the world has the two known aspects: the material (physical) world   and the abstract world (informational). Therefore, a full philosophic approach   must contain the two world &ldquo;types&rdquo;. Before keep going, we must briefly define   what the term &ldquo;world&rdquo; does actually mean.</p>
<p>According to the   common slang, world means a <em>set </em>(of&nbsp;   people), but the term can be extended in order to finally comprise the   set of all the surrounding beings and objects, and according to a more extended   approach, the set of all the material objects with a simultaneous existence on   our planet (and even outside of it). That is, of course, the material world.   Similarly, the set of all the abstract objects which are   stored into the human mind or on external storage media make-up the abstract   world, the set of all the information&rsquo;s existence forms. The &ldquo;vision&rdquo; is   closely related to other terms, which are all belonging to the &ldquo;visual&rdquo; side:   image, structure, form etc. The more coherent, more clear this vision is, the   more outlined is the image, structure and the associated form. As regards the   clarity and the strictness, the optimum and the most general method of   representing a structure is the utilization of the mathematic language, both   with its advantages and disadvantages. An advantage may be the strictness,   logics, accuracy and language universality, while the disadvantages may consist   in the high level of education and intelligence required for its understanding.   The mathematic language of the objectual philosophy is based, besides the   average and high complexity level notions, on other five specific notions: <em>distribution</em>, <em>object</em>, <em>process,</em> <em>flux </em>and <em>medium</em>, and each of these concepts is minutely   described in a separate chapter. These notions, alongside a collection of eight   axioms and five principles make-up the backbone of the structure (vision) of the   objectual philosophy, applicable both for the material and the abstract   world.</p>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.04in; page-break-after: avoid">&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Why objectual?</H2>
<p>As we are going to see   in chapters 3, 8 and 9, the <em>object</em> term designates an informational   entity, a notion which represents a finite information amount which may be   distinguished, stored and subsequently recognized by an IPS (information   processing system). The objectual approach starts even from the observation that   any form of thinking (even a philosophical one) is a processing operation of the   information found within the thinker&rsquo;s brain, and this information processing   operation has a general model, which shall be presented in chapter 8. Here,   besides the general compulsory structure of an IPS, the fundamental role of the   ISS (information support systems), which represents the link between material   and abstract world is minutely underlined. Without these ISS, no information   processing process is possible and the introduction, description and the   utilization method is one of the &ldquo;patents&rdquo; of this philosophy. After the   comprehension of IPS and of the information processing operations, the axioms   which rule this processes come out almost naturally.</p>
