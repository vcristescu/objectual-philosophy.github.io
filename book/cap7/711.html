7.1.1 State systems</H3>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The careful
observation of the processes produced inside a large-sized social
system (for example, a contemporary state) reveals us numerous
objects movements (fluxes) deployed inside it. These extremely varied
fluxes may be fluxes of people (towards and from specific locations:
home, work place, school, church, supermarket, recreation places
etc.), fluxes of goods (food, clothes, household products etc.),
fluxes of ISS (newspapers, magazines, books, audio-video cassettes,
CD&rsquo;s, radio-TV shows etc.), raw stocks, fuel, electric power
fluxes and many more.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">These fluxes occur
mostly inside the state&rsquo;s borders, they are therefore <U>confined</U>
(closed) inside this area. But there are also numerous fluxes which
take place through the <I>real boundary surface</I> (RBS, which shall
be defined in a subsequent section) of the state system, namely,
fluxes of people, finished products, raw stocks, fuels etc. This RBS
which limits the inner spatial domain of the state system is made-up
from the terrestrial, sea and air borders (boundaries) of the state,
and these are limits settled as a result of the interactions with the
neighboring countries (wars, conventions, treaties etc.), and this
RBS is strictly controlled and protected by the government of that
state. In fact, if there is no flux which makes the attempt to cross
it, this is an abstract area (it does not exist always physically,
but its sizes are settled by means of the world conventions on the
territory space), but at the moment of an intrusion flux occurrence,
the inner defense system (which is as real as it can be) grants it
the status of RBS, by means of specific fluxes which are opposed
against any unauthorized flux who tries to cross it.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">We have (as we are
about to see later on) a case of stochastic, non-permanent RBS, which
includes an equilibrium surface between two opposite fluxes which
interact each other: fluxes which try to enter or exit through RBS
and fluxes which are against these processes (the latter are fluxes
belonging to the state&rsquo;s inner defense system). The fluxes
access through this surface is strictly monitored and it can be done
(in most of the cases) only through specialized areas of this RBS,
the so-called transit areas (custom houses). In these areas, the
input/output (import/export) fluxes are either accepted or rejected,
the conveyed (closed) and reflected fluxes will therefore exist.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The coherent inner
fluxes, which are vital for the state system, have, as any other
flux, some stocks from which they are originating: raw stocks, fuels,
food, people etc. That particular stocks are either natural (deposits
found on the territory of that state, agricultural, forestry
resources etc.) or artificial, as a result of the storage of some
coherent import fluxes, or as a result of the objects synthetization
in production systems. The amount of these stocks determines the
lifespan of the state system; under the assumption of a total
isolation (for instance, a total embargo), that is the absence of the
import/export fluxes, the state shall run normally until the
depletion of these stocks. The maintenance along an endless duration
of the system&rsquo;s integrity under the conditions of the existence
of finished inner stocks is therefore possible only by means of the
existence of some import/export fluxes (interchange) with other
similar external systems.</P>
