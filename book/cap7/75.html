<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">7.5 Inertia</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The temporary
opposition and the delay in the state change, currently known as
<I>inertia</I>, is mainly due to the fact that an overall (external)
state variation may occur only after this variation is transmitted
(distributed) to <U>all</U> the system&rsquo;s elements which are
found inside RBS. Since these elements interact one another, it must
that the state variation to <U>be propagated</U> (to be transmitted
from one element to another) along the entire set of the inner
elements, propagation which always requires a finite time. But, since
the SM model is obviously the same, regardless of their structural
level, the inertia and implicitly, the opposition to change is also
applicable to the elements with lower organization levels which are
in the composition of a system. As it was mentioned above, within the
opposition interval against the state change, MS responds to the
action of the flux agent with a flux which is contrary to the agent
one - the <I>reaction flux</I>.</P>

7.5.1: If we kick a ball with the foot, or a pool ball with the cue,
in both cases, the incident flux is a coherent kinetic flux of the
foot or of the cue, which are transformed at the impact with the
driven object (which was initially considered motionless), in a
coherent/stochastic flux (a pressure shock wave starting from the
kicked area). Despite of this incident flux, the driven object would
not be moved (but it would be locally deformed), up to the moment
when the incident shock wave would have not been propagated towards
the opposite wall of the impact area, propagation which means a
distribution of the immergent flux over all the elements of the inner
medium of the driven object (transmitting motion), distribution which
requires a finite temporal interval for its completion (as any other
real process). The definition 7.5.1 is also valid with no
restrictions for the actions in which information fluxes are
involved, actions which are frequently found in the biotic world. In
case of the bio-systems, an immergent data flux (we shall see in
chapter 8 that that particular flux must be included into the
perception domain of the inner IPS), shall initiate a processing of
the information contained in that flux (process equivalent to a
composition of fluxes), processing which means the comparison of this
information with the already-existing (saved) information stock, and
only after the completion of this process, the decision regarding the
outer state modification may be taken, the behavior act released as a
response to the incident flux (stimulus). As regards this temporal
interval needed for the information processing (mostly concerning the
processing which involves the central system - brain), as a result of
the evolution, the advanced bio-systems have preserved for some
information fluxes which show an imminent danger, requiring a fast
response, a way of avoiding the normal information processing (which
is time consumer, with high inertia level), by means of
pre-programmed behavior acts, released by specific stimulus (reflex
acts), which requires a much shorter time for its initiation, with
only a low number of neurons involved.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">At a first
analysis, taking into account the general structure of a MS produced
by the flux triad model, the result is that the quantitative value of
the inertia property of a MS as compared to a <I>k</I>-type agent
flux is:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In direct ratio to the system&rsquo;s
	isolation degree as compared to the <I>k</I>-type external agent
	flux (the isolation degree regarding <I>k</I>-type flux is in
	inverse proportion with RBS permeability against <I>k</I>-type flux,
	and with RBS area). The higher is the isolation degree for an outer
	incident flux with specific density, the lower is the immergent flux
	and accordingly, the lower state variation will be;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In direct ratio to the proper
	inertia of the inner elements of MS and to their number;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In inverse ratio to the intensity
	and the temporal distribution of the interactions between the inner
	elements of MS (in case of the powerful and permanent interactions,
	the inner propagation rate of the state variations is higher, so the
	response is faster). If the number of the inner elements of a MS is
	known, as well as their type, and if they have their own inertia, in
	case they make-up a G medium and because this medium type has the
	lowest interaction rate (mediated throughout time), and therefore,
	the lowest propagation rate, MS inertia will be also higher as
	compared to the cases when the inner elements would make-up L or
	S-type systems.</P>

7.5.2: As for the information interactions between people, it may be
noted that the informational inertia (determined by means of the
temporal interval between the impact of an information flux received
by a person and the external behavior changes produced by that
particular flux), is related to &ldquo;the permeability&rdquo; of the
driven person to the information flux. A man which is cursed in its
native language may have a fast and violent behavior reaction; the
same man which is cursed in a language who does not know it, and in
the absence of other visible hostile gestures, has an infinite
inertia (lack of behavior reaction) which is due to a total
isolation, because when a language is not known, this is the
equivalent of a null permeability at the semantic component of the
information flux released in that language. The state  variation
(behavior) at the same incident flux is different depending on the
amount of the stored information fluxes (related to the education
level and to the life experience), but also depending on the temper
type of the individual (which may be equivalent with the type of
inner interactions deployed between the organism&rsquo;s elements -
nervous, hormonal ones - determined by the genetic legacy). If we are
still referring to the information inertia domain, a rumor with the
same interest degree (an agent information flux with the same
intensity) shall be distributed on a set of human individuals which
are engaged in a information interaction (possible communication),
and it will generate a general opinion of the individuals (outer
state) regarding the rumor&rsquo;s semantic content, in different
ways, depending on the existing community type. Thus, in a rural
settlement where the population is spread and the communication
between families takes place only occasionally, the rumor propagation
is much more slower (as well as the formation of a general opinion),
as compared to the case of some company&rsquo;s employers which have
closer and more frequent information interactions. These examples of
information inertia in the field of the human bio-systems, which are
much easier for the reader to understand them, have also a precise
goal: if the agent information flux would be substituted by an energy
flux, and the human individuals would be substituted by abiotic MS,
we could better understand the explanation given for the &ldquo;physical&rdquo;
inertia of these systems, stated by the objectual philosophy.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
