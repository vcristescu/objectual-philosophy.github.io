<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">7.6.2 Energy
types</H3>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">There are a lot of
&ldquo;energy forms&rdquo; depicted in the nowadays scientific
literature. We should discuss a little bit about the term of &ldquo;energy
form&rdquo; because, at least apparently, there is a contradiction
between this term and the assertion specific to this paper which
states that all the known energy forms have a common component - that
is <U>the motion</U> of MS. When we have presented the material
fluxes, we saw that a flux like this implies an energy as an overall
property of all MS involved in the motion process, that is a property
evaluated by considering a reference system. This flux meant a
spatial distribution of some MS which were moving in bulk with a
common component of the velocity (if this component really exists),
and with specific components of the velocity per each MS involved in
this flux (evaluated against a common component as reference). The
flux&rsquo;s overall energy means the gathering of all the individual
energies of the flux elements, otherwise speaking, each of these
elements is an <I>energy carrier</I> (there is a distribution of the
overall energy on the elements involved in flux).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Well, since these
energy carriers can be all kind of MS (with various organization
levels) the fluxes in which these objects are involved shall have
different denominations. On the other hand, the fluxes may be also
classified as propagation or displacement, coherent or stochastic,
therefore, for each flux with different attributes, a specific energy
&ldquo;form&rdquo; is associated, according to the current language.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The energy of a MS
is a property of a complex object, which means that it is
decomposable by means of distribution on the organization levels (in
an analytical sense) of this object against a reference level<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>4</SUP></A>5.
Let us assume that there is a motionless MS against an outer
reference, let us say SM<SUB>k </SUB>and that it has an analytical
structure level <I>n</I> which means that it has other MS with
organization levels<I> n-p</I> (<I>p=1, 2, ...n-1</I>)<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym" SDFIXED><SUP>4</SUP></A>6
in its inner structure, which move against the inner reference of
SM<SUB>k</SUB>, but their motion occurs inside RBS of MS<SUB>k</SUB>.
These inner MS shall have an energy different from zero both against
the inner reference and against the outer one (because the inner MS
moves also against the outer reference, but their motion is
imperceptible from the outside of MS<SUB>k</SUB>, or otherwise
speaking, the coherent component common to all the internal fluxes is
null against outer reference, but its specific components are
non-zero). These inner fluxes which are closed in RBS of MS<SUB>k</SUB>,
have associated energy values whose overall sum of all its elements
provides the total internal energy of MS<SUB>k</SUB>, but this energy
is not directly transmissible to other MS outside MS<SUB>k</SUB>.</P>

7.6.2.1: The inner translation, rotation, vibration, deformation
motions etc. are inner motions of MS elements; therefore, these
motion types would be related to inner energy forms of MS, specific
components to the elements or to the group of elements found in the
composition of that MS, non-transmissible (stored) energy, under the
form of closed EF inside RBS of MS. The bonding energy (such as
nuclear, ionic, covalent, Van der Waals-type etc.) may be also
included in the same class of the inner energy variety, being stored
into the interchange (interactive) fluxes deployed between the
elements of a MS, as well as the rest energy or the thermal energy in
case of the thermally insulated MS. All the inner energy versions
have a general feature - are energies stored in closed fluxes inside
a MS.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

therefore, it will be a common component on the set of the inner
elements, and this component may be transferred to other outer MS
(because it is an open flux). In this case, the individual velocity
of the inner elements shall be vectorially composed with common
velocity. We have seen in the previous chapters that the motion of
some MS with the same velocity is associated with a <I>coherent flux</I>.</P>

7.6.2.2: For a vigilant reader, the <I>kinetic energy</I> term is a
pleonasm if we take into account the definition 7.6.1.1 which is
given to the energy and the etymology of the word <I>kinetic</I>
(derived from the Greek term <I>kineticos</I> - which is moving).
This term was kept in the present paper only due to historical
reasons and for a gradual transition to the terms used in the classic
physics and within the objectual philosophy. When we have defined the
coherent fluxes, we noticed that these fluxes may have <U>coherency
degrees</U>. In case of the translation fluxes defined through the
common velocity of the inner T reference of the flux objects, with an
even distribution of this velocity on the object&rsquo;s inner
elements, the flux is entirely coherent (more exactly, component T of
the flux is totally coherent). In this case, the energy associated to
this totally coherent translation flux (known as <I>impulse</I>) is a
<I>translation kinetic energy</I>. In case of some coherent rotation
fluxes of an object around a common axis, the coherency degree is
lower (only the axis, direction and the angular speed remain
invariant) but it will also be the kinetic rotation energy with a
non-even distribution because the velocity is also non-evenly
distributed. Attention! Since the rotation kinetic energy is
associated to a closed flux, at the same time, this is an <U>inner
energy form</U> of a MS under rotation, because all the flux lines
are closed into RBS, generated as a result of the object&rsquo;s
motion (see the example from the section 7.2.5). The partial coherent
fluxes are also the propagation fluxes, the wave front moving towards
a specific direction by carrying the energy variation contained in
this front with the propagation speed.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Now, it is time to
analyze what is happening with the stochastic fluxes, more precisely,
in case of a G medium made-up from the molecules of a gas placed in a
container. Inside this medium, there is a set of corpuscular and
coherent elementary fluxes (coherent only at the molecular level),
but which they do not have a common component at the set level (of
Euler distribution of SEP in a given moment), which means that the
set of objects which are engaged in an irregular motion does not have
a global motion against an outer reference (the gas enclosure is
motionless).<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> </FONT>During their motion, the
molecules will collide both each other and with the enclosure&rsquo;s
wall (global RBS), their flux lines being Brownian, random motions
which are closed into the global RBS, the total energy which is
associated to these motions is the inner energy (baric) of the gas
contained in the recipient. The molecular fluxes into G-media are T+R
fluxes, but the component R is momentarily let aside because it has a
low influence in the interaction processes (the component T prevails
because it is an open flux). The elementary (molecular) fluxes are
therefore kinetic energy fluxes, but they do not have a common
component, but only specific properties (directions, intensities,
etc.) Otherwise speaking, the kinetic energy is found in the total
set of the gas molecules, without the existence of a common motion of
this set.</P>

7.6.2.3: The fact that, according to the objectual philosophy, the
potential energy has also a kinetic energy as &ldquo;its origin&rdquo;,
but an energy which is distributed on elementary fluxes with
stochastic global distribution, will help us to coherently understand
&ldquo;the mechanism&rdquo; of the forces generation within the
motionless material media, but which own an uneven distribution of
the energy density on each element. This is possible even for the
gravitation force, electric force etc., but with one condition - we
must accept that these forces are generated as a result of a kinetic
energy which is found <U>at the level of the medium&rsquo;s element</U>.
Another major amendment of the concepts from the physics which comes
from this definition is the one related to what (or who) owns this
potential energy. According to the current physics<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym" SDFIXED><SUP>4</SUP></A>8,
an object which is in <U>a rest state</U> against a RS (considered as
absolute) may have <I>potential energy</I> if it is under the action
of an energy field, namely, in a space where there is a stochastic
energy flux with an uneven flux density. As compared to this
approach, the present paper asserts that it <U>is not the body which
owns the potential energy,</U> but <U>the support medium of the
stochastic flux</U> placed around the body, and which, as a result of
the interaction with that body, shall convey to that particular body
a part from the energy stored in the medium at the initial spatial
position, and in case that body is free, that energy shall be turned
into kinetic energy (coherent flux). The energy transfer between the
medium and the body shall continue as long as there will be a
gradient of the energy density at the body&rsquo;s spatial position.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When we talked about the general MS
model proposed by the objectual philosophy (3<B>F</B> model), we saw
that any MS has a set of output fluxes (see paragr.7.2.4), fluxes
efferent from MS which determine the existence of the fields
generated by that MS, according to the definition 7.2.4.2. Based on
this definition, the <I>k</I>-type field of a MS is given by the
spatial-temporal distribution of the emergent<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym" SDFIXED><SUP>4</SUP></A>9
<I>k-</I>type flux from MS. But, as it was already mentioned so far,
a flux cannot exist without being related to an energy, otherwise
speaking, <I>k</I>-type flux has a specific field energy distributed
across its entire existence range, and this energy has an uneven
density which (in case of an isotropic spatial distribution against
the inner RS of MS) varies in inverse ratio to the distance towards
the source MS.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
7.6.2.4: The above-mentioned definition asserts that the energy
related to a field generated by a MS, field which in theory, goes to
infinity, <U>it is not finite either</U>. Indeed, the <I>k</I>-type
field of a MS is continuously supplied through the emergent k-type
flux, coming from the fluxes stored inside MS, starting at the moment
of MS generation, and the stored fluxes are also supplied by the
input fluxes of MS (coming from the outside). As long as these
processes keep going, the existence of a MS will also continue, as
well as the existence of its fields. As it was mentioned in section
7.2.4, the emergent fluxes from a MS, with its associated fields, are
able to exist during finite time intervals even in the absence of the
input fluxes, that time interval is the lifespan of a MS concerning
that flux type. If we are making an extreme simplification of a MS
given by the flux triad model, we may find that a MS is nothing but a
common flux converter, which turns the convergent fluxes <U>on</U>
RBS (outer influxes) or <U>through</U> RBS (outer trafluxes) into
divergent fluxes <U>through</U> RBS (inner trafluxes) or <U>on</U>
RBS (outer refluxes).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the <I>k</I>-type flux is at
least partly coherent (having an invariant direction - from MS to the
outside) and open, some of its energy may be transmitted to any MS
with whom it intersects to, therefore it can generate actions.</P>
