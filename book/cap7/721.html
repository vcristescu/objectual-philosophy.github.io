7.2.1 Bounding surfaces</H3>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The first material
systems where we first met the &ldquo;bounding surface&rdquo; term
were the distributed systems, which were briefly approached in the
previous chapter. If they have a permanent interaction (such as the S
or L-type ones), these types of material systems have also their own
volume and a surface which confines this volume, and due to this
reason, it is called <I>bounding surface.</I> All the exchanges
between the outer and inner systems take place through this surface.
These exchanges are defined by the transfer through the bounding
surface of some distributed amounts, process which it is called flux,
as we have previously mentioned. Therefore, fluxes (displacement or
propagation type) may cross through the bounding surface, both inward
and outward of the volume confined by it. The fluxes oriented inward
of the surface shall lead to accumulations into the confined volume
of the amount carried by these fluxes (which are therefore positive
quantities or stock increment), whereas the outward-oriented fluxes
shall lead to a stock decrement of those amounts.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Due to this reason,
the fluxes whose FDV are oriented inward of the bounding surface
shall be considered as positive. The bounding surface of a body <U>is
not a theoretical surface </U>(computing, imaginary, abstract),
similar with the surfaces from mathematics or from the theoretical
physics. Not all the incident fluxes are able to run freely through a
surface like this; some of them shall cross only partly, some, not at
all (they shall be totally repulsed, reflected). By considering <I>I</I><SUB><I>ik</I></SUB>
as the intensity of an incident <I>k</I>-type flux on the bounding
surface (intensity given by the relation 5.2.1.4), and <I>I</I><SUB><I>tk</I></SUB>
which is the intensity of the same type of flux which has succeeded
to cross it (flux transmitted through the bounding surface).</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Definition
7.2.1.1:</B> <B>The transmittance</B> (permeability, transparency) of
the bounding surface for <I>k</I>-type fluxes is considered to be the
following amount:</FONT></FONT></P>

	(7.2.1.1)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">where index <I>k</I> is a running
number from a list of all the fluxes which are incident along the
surface, selected according to the transported amount (energy,
information, structure objects etc.) or according to other
distinctive properties of them. It is obvious that there is a
different transparency of a certain bounding surface related to the
various fluxes which cross it, but it ranges within the same
interval, between <I>0</I> and <I>1.</I></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The numerical value
of the bounding surfaces transmittance allows their classification in
two major groups:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Real</I> surfaces, with <I>p</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB><I>
	&lt; 1</I> for the real fluxes;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Abstract</I> surfaces

	abstract models of the real surfaces), for which<IMG SRC="721_html_54aabfc4.gif" NAME="Object231" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=43 HEIGHT=24>,
	for any type of flux (total permeability), because these surfaces do
	not physically exist.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Few remarks seem to be necessary:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the objectual
	philosophy, the only real surfaces are the bounding surfaces of MS,
	which shall be called <I>real bounding surfaces </I>(RBS);</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the real surfaces, the
	transmitted flux shall be always lesser than the incident flux.</P>
