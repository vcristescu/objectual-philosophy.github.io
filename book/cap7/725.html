7.2.5 RBS types</H3>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">We have noticed in
the previous sections that RBS is a spatial zone with a non-even
distribution of the flux density, zone which is found at the
boundaries of a MS. The figures 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.4.1 have shown some
cross sections running through these zones. If due to simplicity
reasons, we shall consider that the surface 
<IMG SRC="725_html_68b31e89.gif" NAME="Object265" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=24>
of the inner medium M<SUB>1</SUB> has a spherical shape, then, the
section from this figure might be seen as a fraction of a radial
section running through RBS. In this case, the unevenness of the flux
density distribution from the transition space is radial (the normal
lines <B>n</B><SUB><I><B>I</B></I></SUB> and <B>n</B><SUB><I><B>E</B></I></SUB><B>
</B>being collinear with the radius of the inner domain). According
to the definition 7.2.2.1, for each RBS there is a certain <I>p</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB>
value of its transmittance, which is specific to a certain <I>k-</I>type
of flux which tries to cross it. The numerical value of this
transmittance may be dependent by means of a relation <I>f</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB>
which is characteristic to each <I>k</I>-type flux, by the value of
another attribute (which is considered to be independent). For
instance, in case of a S-type distributed MS, made-up from atoms,
which has an invariant spatial distribution<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>3</SUP></A>6
against its inner reference system (that is also a spatial one), the

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">defines, under polar coordinates, (more
appropriate for the spherical shape) the distribution of this
transmittance for a certain type of flux. If we are dealing for
instance, with an atomic or molecular outer influx (an atomic or
molecular beam), at which the RBS transmittance of the
above-mentioned S medium is insignificant (we may consider it null),
in case of a spherical RBS,

distribution is much more complex; fortunately, due to the scope of
this section, we are not interested in the accurate distribution
relations of <I>p</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB>, but rather in the fact that
these distributions really exist, and accordingly, we need to know
what is the independent amount (distribution support). As also
regards the S-type spherical medium (e.g. a bearing ball), the value
of RBS transmittance for the atomic or molecular fluxes is null for
any kind of domain (even an elementary one) of the surface; in this
case, we may state that the <I>surface spatial distribution of p</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB><I>

permeability at the same flux type, a <I>non-even</I> surface

7.2.5.2: The bounding surfaces of S-type media (this category
includes the solids, as well as the bio-systems, or the artificial
systems), have a permanency character of the transmittance if the
intensity of the incident flux does not exceed the dissociation
threshold of the medium&rsquo;s elements, or the medium type change
(phase transformation). In case of the bio-systems, the form of the
outer RBS (plasma membrane of cells, or the epidermis of the evolved
organisms) is generally variable (the bio-systems are MS with
controlled deformability), but this aspect does not impair the value

RBS of the rotating body is impermeable to the <B>F </B>flux, as a

The motion of the solid body across the circular pathway means a flux
which is distributed in a toroidal volume, which is a constant
effective section flux, existing only under the limits of the toroid
surface. But this fact means that there is a flux inside the toroidal
surface and not in its exterior, therefore, we are dealing with a
non-even spatial distribution of the flux density on this surface

the flux, at the same angular speed, the incident flux shall be

7.2.5.3: The fact that a non-even distribution of a flux generates a
RBS becomes obvious for the human eye if the incident <B>F</B> flux
from the figure 7.2.5.1 is a photon flux from the visible range. In
such case, the eye is able to see a part of the scattered photon
flux, and if the body&rsquo;s rotational period is shorter than the
eye inertia (about 0.1 s), we would be able to see a diffuse toroidal
surface and not the spherical body, as if a toroidal object would be
found at that position.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">An interesting case
for this kind of &ldquo;revolution-type&rdquo; (non-permanent) RBS is
the one when the <B>F</B> flux continues to be parallel with the axis
<I>xy</I> (for simplicity), but it is corpuscular, with its effective
section equal or less than the cross section of the rotating
spherical body and it occurs <I>periodically</I> (pulsating). In this
case, a dependence of the toroidal RBS permeability is generated not
only by the transfer rate but also by the frequency and the phase of
the periodical flux; by assuming that the revolution frequency and
the flux frequency are equal, if the moment of the flux occurrence
coincides with the moment of the body presence, the transmittance is
null, increasing according as the displacement reaches the boundaries
of the circular object and it is unitary during the remaining period.
This clearly shows that as regards the revolution-type RBS (or
oscillating) there is the possibility that under specific
conditions<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym" SDFIXED><SUP>3</SUP></A>9,
their transmittance to be equal to one (because RBS does not really
exist for that temporal range). Does it not seem to you that this

7.2.5.4: When we have presented the state&rsquo;s RBS and its defense
system, we were talking just about this kind of RBS, because in case
of an external aggression, (an outer unauthorized influx which tries
to penetrate that particular RBS), the defense system also fights
back  with a flux, but an opposite type of flux, which by means of
composition (interaction between the flux objects) must stop (in the
first stage) the aggression flux and then, it must reject it (the
reflexion&rsquo;s equivalent) to the outside. If we take as example
an air-borne assault during the second world war, the outer influx
was made from an escadrille of bombardment aircrafts, and the inner
influx consisted in a set of projectiles which were shot by the
anti-aircraft artillery or by the hunting aircrafts. The impact
between the elements of those two opposite fluxes had a partly
deterministic character (the missiles&rsquo;s aiming and guiding
systems), but also a major random weight (either due to the weather
conditions, or due to technical malfunctions or gun crew ability).
Finally, the entire interaction process of the two fluxes took place
on a RBS with stochastic distribution, with a couple of km thickness
(the zone of the air combat), with the equilibrium surface placed
inside it (this will be a concept developed later on), which was able
to move depending on the flux resources of the two parts, either
outward (aggression fight-off), or inward (aggression success).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The stochastic RBS
may be widely found inside DS (more clear at G-type ones), where
every element of the medium &ldquo;is competing&rdquo; with its
nearby neighbors for the division of an indispensable resource -
space - more precisely, its vital space in which the outer kinetic
flux of the element is confined (that is the space required for the
element&rsquo;s individual motion, which is in relation to its energy
amount taken from the total energy stockpile of the medium from which
it belongs to). This volume which is statistically computed by
comparing the volume of medium to the number of elements, is an
abstract volume (a mean calculus value); in fact, the elements which
temporarily own a higher energy amount (the ones placed on Maxwell&rsquo;s
curve of the velocity distributions towards high speed values) shall
have a higher available space (that is the equivalent of a palace in
the people&rsquo;s world (#)), whereas the elements with energy
resources less than the mean values, must get content to a much less
space. Relevant for our discussion is the fact that on this
stochastic RBS which settles the specific volume per each element,
the sum of the outer kinetic trafluxes of the nearby elements at a
medium, under an equilibrium state, must be equal to the traflux
(also kinetic) of the element from the inside, which means that
inside this elementary stochastic RBS to exist the equilibrium
surface of the two opposite fluxes, and this surface to be invariant
(obviously, on average basis as well).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The RBS
classifications which were mentioned so far have been made according
to the distribution type criterion of its transmittance. RBS can be
also categorized according to the organization level (on the abiotic
scale) of the objects which are set in motion, and which in this way,
will generate the unevenness of the motion distribution which is
required for the occurrence of a RBS. If we are starting from EP
level, it is obvious that the material systems belonging to this
class have an external RBS (which intervene for instance in case of
the collisions between particles). The transfer processes of the
fluxes which make-up the electric, magnetic, nuclear or gravitation
fields (towards and from EP) are located through this RBS, as well as
the kinetic fluxes of the neighbouring EP, or of the photons which
cross through this surface. At the moment of a bi-particle system
formation, system made-up from two EP with opposite charges, the
motions of the two system elements shall be two fluxes confined in
the volume occupied by the system (for example, the volume of a
hydrogen atom). These closed fluxes shall produce two RBS with
spatial-temporal distributions as it was mentioned above, RBS with
deterministic (periodical) distributions, which are spatially
disjoint or conjunct, out of which, an internal one (generated by the
proton&rsquo;s motion) and an external one (generated by the motion
of the peripheral electron). We have already noticed that in case of
RBS with spatial-temporal distribution, so that a flux transfer
between elements can be possible, the two distributions must be
inter-related, but most of all, to exist a inter-correlation at the
phase level of the flux frequency. Otherwise speaking, MS made up
from EP must have an inner coherency of the flux frequency at the
phase level (we shall see later on that this coherency must be in a
co-phasal state, or as it is also called, with positive reaction). We
are not going to minutely describe the atomic structure, but we shall
only find that the union of the real bounding surfaces generated by
the proton and neutron motions will lead to the formation of nuclear
RBS, and the RBS union generated by the motion of the peripheral
electrons shall make-up the electronic outer RBS, divided also in
layers with spatial-temporal distributions specific to the individual
electronic orbitals. These electronic RBS which have became spatially
conjunct as a result of the atoms assembling (through chemical
bonds), shall make-up the molecular RBS, and further on, RBS of NM
(permanent in case of liquids or solids, stochastic for gases).</P>

7.2.5.5: The RBS of MS are very different, mostly due to the
organization level of the material system which owns them, but
absolute all of them are in accordance with the above-mentioned
mathematic model. For example, the atmosphere of a planet with its
radial-uneven distribution (its density varying exponentially with
the radius), makes-up a RBS with different attributes according to
the effective section of the incident fluxes; in case of corpuscular
fluxes with the size grade of the effective section equal or less
than the cross section of the gas molecules (for example, high energy
EP or photons), the atmosphere will behave like a stochastic RBS,
whereas for the compact isotomic fluxes with large sections (e.g.:
meteorites or comet nucleus) the same atmosphere shall be a RBS with
a permanent and quasi-even surface distribution of the transmittance.
In case of these latter fluxes, and depending on their intensity,
incidence angle and effective section, a transmission (by hitting the
earth crust) or a reflexion (through deflection to the cosmic space)
of that flux<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym" SDFIXED><SUP>4</SUP></A>0
might be generated. A RBS can be also considered as the outer limit
of the terrestrial magnetosphere, which by means of its uneven
distribution of the magnetic flux (stored inside the magnetosphere)
is able to deflect the coherent flux of the solar wind (made-up from
ionized atoms and EP) which cross through this magnetosphere, by
protecting in this way the terrestrial biosphere against the harmful
effects of these ionizing radiations.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	moment of the entrance into the atmosphere (incidence angle), the
	deviation from this angle might lead either to the thermal
	destruction of the ship or to its reflection back into the cosmic
	space.</P>
