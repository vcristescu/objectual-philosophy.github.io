<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
7.6.1.1: As I have also mentioned on other occasions, according to
the present paper, any property of an object has two components:
<I>qualitative</I> component, which is conjointly associated with the
<I>quantitative </I>component (attribute quantity which is contained
by the object). The above-mentioned definition is valid for the
<U>qualitative</U> component of the <I>energy</I> property, otherwise
speaking, if there are two bodies out of which one is moving against
a common external RS and the other one is motionless, we know that
the body which moves <U>has energy</U> (against that particular RS)
and the steady body does not have energy, without being able (at
least for the time being) to specify the amount of this property for
the moving object. As it was pointed out at the third assertion, a
distributed motion is a flux, therefore, a MS flux is inseparably
related to the existence of the energy distributed on the MS set, and
their energy is conjointly related to the existence of their motion.
On the other hand, definition 7.6.1.1 clearly underlines the
significance of the reference system against which the energy is
evaluated (as any other property); as compared to an absolute
reference, the energy of a MS is made-up from the energy of all the
motion types of the material system which can be determined against
such a reference. This fact also means that for any distinct motion
type of a MS, we would be able to assign (merely formal) an energy
type, although these energy types are only facets of the same
property given by the definition 7.6.1.1. If there is also a common
velocity (group velocity) of a compound MS, an energy related to that
velocity exists as well, and it is distributed along all the elements
of the MS (if the elements are identical, there will be an even
distribution).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">We have seen that
any MS has a triad of material fluxes in its structure. But, the
<I>material flux</I> means the <U>motion of MS</U> and their motion
means <U>energy</U>. The energy necessary for maintaining the fluxes
(energy demand) cannot be created &ldquo;from nothing&rdquo;, but it
can be taken either from its storage zones (the energy of the stored
fluxes inside MS at the moment of its formation), or from the outer
open fluxes which are already found outside MS (the photon fluxes
coming from the Sun and falling down on the Earth surface, thermal
fluxes inside the planet, water fluxes (rivers, streams, tides), air
fluxes (wind) so on.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The release
processes of the energy stored inside MS means the conversion of a
part from the inner fluxes (the external inactive ones been closed
fluxes) into active open fluxes which are able to transfer their
energy to other MS. This conversion takes place either at the atomic
level by means of the chemical reactions, or at the nuclear level, by
means of the nuclear reactions, or at the level of complementary
equal-mass EP, through the annihilation reaction. Dissociation of a
specific type of MS with a certain structure may be found at the
basis of most of these processes, followed by the formation of other
MS with a lower energy stock from its components. In chapter 3, we
have discussed about the <I>generating processes</I>, stating that no
attribute of an object can occur (which means that it must have a
non-zero quantitative attribute) unless a specific generating process
is produced. The energy of a MS is a property, so that it must also
have its specific generating process.</P>

to other MS).</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

7.6.1.2: Axiom III is founded under various forms to most of the
materialistic philosophies (non-creationistic) and according to the
current physics, it is also known as the <I>principle of energy
conservation</I>. It tries to avoid some basic questions which have
not been answered so far: If the energy cannot be generated from
nothing, being possible only the redistribution of an
already-existing energy, how did this energy (which is considered
invariant in some conditions) occur? What is its generating process?
Which is the reference system against which this constant energy
stockpile can be evaluated?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Therefore, the
energy of a MS is considered as an <U>exclusively transmissible
attribute</U>, which means that, in case of a given object with an
intact and stable inner structure, that particular attribute may be
generated only from the <U>outside</U>, from other objects which
already have it (outer fluxes) and which will be transmitted in a
certain ratio to the driven object, if those fluxes cross through RBS
of the object.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="ener_flux"></A>
In the present paper, the energy transfer from one MS to another
shall be named <I>transaction</I>. This term (minutely described in
annex X.10) has the same semantic value (meaning) within the value
fluxes field, as the word <I>interaction</I> within the field of
energy or information fluxes. The bilateral transactions, as a
property (attribute) exchange between two partners, require the
existence of two situations (states) of the attribute amount owned by
the two partners: 1) <I>before </I>the transaction, and 2) <I>after</I>
the transaction. Let us presume that in the <I>before </I>situation
(state), the two objects <I>Ob</I><SUB><I>A</I></SUB> and <I>Ob</I><SUB><I>B</I></SUB>
have an inner distribution of the quantities <I>e</I><SUB><I>A1</I></SUB>
and <I>e</I><SUB><I>B1</I></SUB> of the attribute E (energy). After
the transaction (of the exchange, interaction process) completion,
the two objects shall reach the quantities <I>e</I><SUB><I>A2</I></SUB>
and <I>e</I><SUB><I>B2</I></SUB> of the energy attribute. Depending
on the specific quantitative energy variation during the transaction,
the energy stockpile of one of the two objects may be higher or lower
than the initial one, after the transaction completion; if the energy
stockpile is higher, this means that the transaction was <I>favorable
</I>(constructive) for that object, and on the contrary, <I>unfavorable</I>
(destructive). The principle of energy conservation (which shall be
analyzed later on) states that <U>if the two objects are considered
to be isolated</U> from other external actions and loss fluxes, the
total energy (amount of the two energy values owned by the two
objects) remains invariant. Because the transferred energy is carried
by a flux from one object to another, the fluxes which have only the
energy as their transported property (which concerns us and which
shall be transmitted to the objects with whom the flux interacts)
shall be named <I><B>energy fluxes</B></I> (EF).</P>

7.6.1.3: Even if a flux carries a set of properties, only the

existential attribute<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym" SDFIXED><SUP>4</SUP></A>4-

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the
assertion that the outer energy of a MS which was already formed and
in stable state may come from the outside only, the validity domain
of the energy conservation principle from the current physics may be
therefore estimated: <I>The total energy amount of a set of material
objects may be conserved if only the set (system) is completely
isolated from external influences (fluxes)</I> (which may extract
from, or supply energy to the system), and if the <I>emergent fluxes</I>
(losses through fields) <I>from the set are null.</I> A particular
likely case of energy conservation (but only of the energy stored in
the system) is represented by the systems where the input energy
fluxes are equal to the output ones (such as the perfect equilibrium
between system and external medium). Another additional specification
is required in this case, namely, <U>only the inner energy</U> of the
system is conserved and only during the existence of the equilibrium
state.<BR>
