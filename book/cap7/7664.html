<H4 CLASS="western">7.6.6.4 Overall energetical action</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the previous chapter, we have seen
what is the action of an energy flux quantum, that  is a process with
two distinct, disjoint but temporally contiguous phases: <I>incidence
and reflection</I>. Let us further analyze the action process of some
energy fluxes made-up from a large number of quanta, both as an
effective section and by considering the conveyed energy stock. We
have seen that the flux is a spatial-temporal distribution of a
transfer process, therefore, all the quantic processes of the flux
shall be also spatially-temporally distributed. This fact means that
the quantic processes depicted in the above-mentioned section can be
randomly superposed and added, thus giving the impression of the
process continuity. Consequently, although the incidence and
reflection processes are successive at the quantic level, at the
overall distribution level which involves a very large number of
elements, these two processes seem to be simultaneous, because there
is no temporal coherency between the quantic support intervals. That
is the case of the fluxes from L or G media which deploy L or G-type
relations (which were presented in chapters 5 and 6) between their
elements. In case of S-type media, in which there are steady
relations between all the flux&rsquo;s elements, the two processes -
incidence and reflection - can be successive, just as in the quantic
case (elastic collisions). After all these explanation, it is time to
analyze the general process of the energetical action of an EF on a
MS.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Let us presume that we are dealing with
a material body MS<SUB>k</SUB> which is in a rest state against an
external reference system RS<SUB>e</SUB>, the position vector of the
body against this reference being the invariant<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>5</SUP></A>5
<IMG SRC="7664_html_57d051f5.gif" NAME="Object365" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=21>.
The spatial state of MS<SUB>k</SUB> is in this case a S<SUB>0</SUB>
state, as long as the body remains motionless. A spatial state change
of this body means a variation of the <I>spatial position</I>
attribute - that is the vector 
<IMG SRC="7664_html_57d051f5.gif" NAME="Object366" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=21>.
However, this kind of variation represents a <I>motion</I>
(translation motion, in this case), process which requires a certain
velocity, and the occurrence of a velocity started by the rest state
means a variation of the velocity rate reaching from zero to any
value, that is an <I>acceleration.</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the body was motionless, it had a
null kinetic energy (against RS<SUB>e</SUB>), but as long as the body
is moving, its energy is non-zero, therefore, for achieving a spatial
state change, the body needs energy, which is provided only from the
outside, from another body which owns a transmissible energy, namely
from an open <I>energy flux</I> (EF). We have seen in the previous
sections that the energy is an exclusively transmissible property,
coming from a MS which has it (which is moving) and which property
can be delivered, through an interaction, to another material body.
First, let us make a review focused only on the body which receives
energy, that is the driven body, represented only within a partly
section in the figure 7.6.6.4.1, displaying an outer energy influx

7.6.6.4.1: Definition 7.6.6.4.1 settles that the force is an EF
(variation of a flux is also a flux), but a special type of flux
which solely occur at the contact of an EF with RBS of a MS.
Otherwise speaking, if there is no RBS with a subunitary permeability
and an energy flux stored inside it, and they both generate a
reflected flux, no force can exist either. Based on the relations
7.6.6.4.4 and 7.6.6.4.5, it may be also noticed that the force also
represents an EF conveyed through a RBS, but only under the presence
of the other components - the incident and reflected flux. The reader
will probably notice that the definition 7.6.6.4.1 is a definition
which does not depend on the Newton&rsquo;s (inertial) force
definition (F=ma) and unlike this latter definition, the definition
7.6.6.4.1 is valid in any circumstances, even for the static
(passive) forces, for which the Newton&rsquo;s definition cannot be
applied.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Both variations of
EF given by the relations 7.6.6.4.4 and 7.6.6.4.5, considered as
equal and opposite, represent the two equal and opposite forces,
which are known in physics as the <I>action and reaction force</I>.
These variations are due to the composition on RBS (more exactly,
into its transition volume) of the external EF with the internal EF,
that is a composition of the homologue elements, which are normal and
tangent respectively, up to the moment when the resources of one of
the fluxes would be depleted.</P>

7.6.6.4.2: If an EF covers an abstract surface (computing, imaginary
one), since it has a total transmittance, a reflected flux cannot
exist and consequently, no force is able to occur on such a surface.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When EF was decomposed on RBS, we
noticed that there are two components of the incident, transmitted
and reflected fluxes, and these are the normal and tangential
components. Therefore, the variations of these fluxes shall also have
two components, fact which generates the occurrence of two force
types at the impact of an EF with RBS: <I>normal force and tangential
force</I>. We have also seen that at the incidence of an external EF,
all its components determine the generation of similar components
inside MS, the reaction fluxes, whose normal and tangential
components will produce the <I>reaction forces</I>, with the two
components: normal and tangential. According to the composition rules
of EF, the existence of the interactive force pairs is provided as
long as the interactive fluxes have enough resources.</P>

7.6.6.4.3: The existence of the normal and tangential components of
the forces into the MS model established by the objectual philosophy
allows a clear and coherent understanding on the occurrence of the
friction forces. According to the physics textbooks, a friction force
is generated when two real objects in contact each other, try to move
one against another. The friction force withstands to the translation
motion of the objects, being proportional (approximative) to the
pressure force of the objects on the contact areas, to the roughness
of the two surfaces, to their adherence degree, and dependent on the
material type of the two objects. Based on the objectual approach,
the friction force is nothing but the tangential component of the
reaction force within the medium of the real surface, that is a force
proportional to the size of the cross-section area of RBS (roughness
of the two real surfaces which interact), to the contact pressure
(level of the baric potential energy from the transition volume of
the two RBS) and it depends on the physical-chemical properties of
the two media which are placed inside the transition volume.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">So far,</FONT> we
have discussed about the interactive forces in case of their
equality, manifested during the equilibrium state, when the
equilibrium surface was remaining motionless against an outer
reference. Let us find out what is happening in case of a
disequilibrium, when the equilibrium surface is displaced.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The figure 7.6.6.4.2 shows an inner

7.6.6.4.4: <B>Attention!</B> According to the classic physics, in
such equilibrium circumstances, there is no energy transfer between
the two media from the volumes <I>V</I><SUB><I>a</I></SUB><I> </I>and
<I>V</I><SUB><I>b</I></SUB>; on the contrary, according to the
objectual philosophy, there is a permanent energy transfer (flux)
between the two media, but with equal and opposite intensity, fluxes
which are represented by the two forces <B>F</B><SUB>a</SUB> and <B>F</B><SUB>b</SUB>.
How could not exist EF when the gas molecules are collided with the
piston surface and they are reflected afterwards? The variation of
their impulse (the one which gives the gas pressure) will always
produce a shock wave inside the piston, wave which will transfer the
energy from the gas towards the piston, and the piston reaction (the
one which generates the reflection of the gas molecules) means an
energy transfer from the piston to the gas.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.6.6.4.6: The relation 7.6.6.4.7 is equivalent to the relation

that all these relations which express the intensity of some EF

elementary EF, namely of an elementary force. Otherwise speaking, the
intensity of an elementary force (an elementary power) is given by
the product between the area of a surface element and the density by

an EF has a well-known name in the objectual philosophy.</P>

7.6.6.4.7: According to the definition 7.6.6.4.1, we have noticed
that the variation of an EF deployed on RBS is a force, and based on
the definition 7.6.6.4.5, the pressure seems to be a surface density
of a force. According to the current scientific literature, there is
the relation F=pS, where F, p and S are scalar quantities (F is the
force modulus, p-pressure and S-surface on which the pressure is
evenly distributed). Since according to the objectual philosophy, the
pressure is the surface density of an EF, namely of a vector field,
this fact clearly shows that the <U>pressure</U> is a flux density,
therefore, <U>a vector.</U> The reason why the pressure is considered
a scalar quantity according to the current physics, is the
<I>scalarization of the vector quantities</I> (see annex X.9), that
is a process which occur if the set of the successive vectors
belonging to a Lagrange distribution or the set of simultaneous
vectors of an Euler distribution do not have a common component.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.6.6.4.8: In the left side of the relation 7.6.6.4.14 we have the
intensity of an EF through a closed surface 
<IMG SRC="7664_html_m76a8a704.gif" NAME="Object422" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=47>,

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A volume density of an amount
distributed in a volume <I>V</I>, becomes, once with the initiation
of the distribution motion, a surface density of that particular flux
amount, through the reference surface &sum; (see the annex X.15). The
definition 7.6.6.4.5 has stated that the pressure is a superficial
density of an EF through the reference surface &sum;, thus, we are
able to draw a very important conclusion that, <U>in case of the
motionless media, the pressure is the volume density of the baric
potential energy</U> stored into the volume V, assertion which is
also upheld by the right member of the relation 7.6.6.4.14. This
energy is stored in an atomic or molecular medium placed into the
volume V, under a stochastic flux form, whose elements (FQV) are the
individual impulses owned by atoms or molecules, set in a chaotic
motion.</P>

7.6.6.4.9: The above underlined statement, which was checked at the
level of the only media known so far (natural media: solid, liquid,
gaseous) is also valid, according to the objectual philosophy, for
the other media generations which were previously described in
chapter 1 (the proximate fundamental media). In other words, if a
medium consists of an amount of distributed potential energy, then, a
pressure must clearly exist and where is a pressure and a MS with its
RBS, a force will also be generated if the pressure spatial
