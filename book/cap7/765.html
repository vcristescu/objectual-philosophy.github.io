Composition of the energy fluxes</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the description of the
generic model of the real bounding surfaces, we have noticed that
these objects (RBS) determine the decomposition of the incident
fluxes into many components. There is a general (de)composition
process of the material fluxes on RBS, which is valid for any kind of
material flux which interacts with a RBS, either they are ware or
people fluxes occurred at the incidence with a state RBS, or
molecular or ionic fluxes in case of a RBS of a living cell
(plasmatic membrane). In case of the RBS of the abiotic MS, the
situation is absolutely similar, only that the number of incident
flux types is much lower than the biotic MS, the structural fluxes
being important in this matter (SF, which shall be presented in the
following section), but moreover, the energy fluxes (EF). Due to this
reason, we shall minutely review the composition of EF on RBS and as
a result of this composition, we would be able to understand that
most of the physical amounts such as the impulse, force, power,
pressure etc. are nothing but some EF or properties of EF.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The composition and decomposition of EF
on RBS of a driven MS is made in accordance with specific rules (we
might even call them <I>laws</I>), which regulate the interaction
(composition) processes between the outer and inner EF stored into
the proper volume of MS. According to the objectual philosophy, these
rules are:</P>

7.6.5.1: This assertion includes all types of RBS which were
aforementioned, including the ones with uneven, non-permanent or
periodical distributions. The composition process is a distributed
process (just as the fluxes) made-up from all the possible
interactions occurred between the elements of the two or more fluxes,
interactions which are placed into the transition volume from the
impact zone. It is clear that in case of the abiotic MS, the flux&rsquo;s
composition processes on RBS of a MS with a certain analytical
structural level may be also decomposed into composition processes of
EF on RBS of the constitutive MS, with more reduced structural
levels. The important issue is that, regardless the structural level,
the fluxes are composed only on a RBS of a MS with that particular
structural level, because only in that place the outer fluxes
interact with the inner fluxes.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.6.5.2: Even if the RBS permeability of a driven MS is null for the
support material objects of EF, there will still be propagation EF on
RBS (surface waves, shock waves etc.) which will always send forward
a part from the incident flux energy to the driven system. Because

at the impact of an outer EF, no matter how powerful is, the state
change of a MS would be null, which means that this system would have

7.6.5.3: Since the fluxes are vector amounts, the addition or
subtraction of the amounts (operations produced during the
composition process) have a meaning only at the level of their
homologous components (which are collinear), so that the flux&rsquo;s
collinear components may be algebraically combined, because only the

is natural that if one of the fluxes is depleted (its intensity is
cancelled) during a composition (interaction) process, the

case of a MS, because its volume is always finite, the EF stockpile
from this volume shall be finite as well, and therefore, during the
composition processes between a field (flux with endless resources as
long as the field source exists) and the stored EF into MS (reaction
flux), the latter would be the first (and only one) which will be
depleted. In case of the composition of two fluxes with finite energy
resources (such as the collision between two MS), the first depleted
components would be the resources of the body with a lower kinetic
energy.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.6.5.6: If the transition volume of the RBS from the impact
(composition) zone of the two coherent and opposite fluxes is
considered a finite volume in which equal energy quantities are
coming through opposite directions, it is natural that the energy&rsquo;s
conservation principle (applied only for the transition volume) to
state that the kinetic energy of the two fluxes does not vanish, but
it is preserved. How is it possible to conserve the kinetic energy in
a motionless space (under equilibrium)? This is simple! As we have
noticed in section 7.6.2, in a stochastic or periodical (coherent
closed) energy flux, the only flux types which are able to store
kinetic energy in a motionless medium (only under a global
motionless, more exactly, the inner T reference is motionless against
an outer T reference, but at the element level, there is an either
chaotic or coherent, but periodical motion).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.6.5.7: This rule is very clear in case of the elastic collisions,
when the stochastic flux stored in the two collided bodies remains
global motionless, until the flux resources of one of the bodies are
depleted. At that moment, the equilibrium state vanishes (without the
opposition of the depleted flux), and the stochastic flux stored into
the contact zone (baric component) shall generate the two repulsion
(deflection) forces which will set in motion in reverse direction the
bodies which are under interaction. But the collision processes also
imply the local heating of the impact zone, process which takes-over
a part of the energy deployed by the two combined fluxes, and which
will make-up the thermal component of the stored flux. It is clear
that this thermal flux, even after the equilibrium vanishing, would
not be converted into a coherent flux, neither do the stochastic
fluxes involved in the plastic collisions.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
