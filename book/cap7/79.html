<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">7.9 Conclusions</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The objectual philosophy proposes an
universal model for any material system, that is a model based on the
notions which were already introduced in the previous chapters:
<I>distribution, object, process, flux</I> and <I>medium</I>. Based
on these notions, a new concept is defined, that is the <I>real
bounding surface</I>, as a spatial zone placed between two abstract
parallel and concentric surfaces, that is a zone where a gradual
transition from a medium with a flux density to another medium with
another flux density takes place. A RBS is different from an abstract
surface by means of two main properties:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Permeability (transparence,
	transmittance) <I>p</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB> in case of a <I>k</I>-type
	flux is always sub unitary (<I>p</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB><FONT FACE="Symbol, serif"><I>&#61500;</I></FONT><I>1</I>).
	The sub unitary transmittance of RBS makes that a flux which is
	incident on it, either from the inside or the outside, to not be
	entirely transmitted and to always exist a deflected (reflected)
	component of this flux.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because RBS has a non-zero
	thickness, the tangential components of the incident, reflected or
	transmitted fluxes can be found on it.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The spatial
distribution of RBS permeability allows their categorization into RBS
with even or non-even spatial distribution, and as regards the
temporal distribution, we may have RBS with even, non-even or
periodical temporal distribution. In general, RBS have
spatial-temporal distributions of the permeability, which are divided
in two classes: RBS with <I>deterministic </I>distributions and
<I>stochastic</I> RBS.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">A MS is made-up
from a closed RBS 
<IMG SRC="79_html_m16eb7a35.gif" NAME="Object424" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=16>
which is the boundary between two complementary spaces - the <I>inner</I>
one with volume <I>V</I> and the <I>outer</I> one. By using this RBS
<IMG SRC="79_html_m16eb7a35.gif" NAME="Object425" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=16>,
we may define three flux classes (a triad):</P>

</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There can be various types of fluxes
which build-up a triad, based on the attribute (property) type which
is carried by the flux, but they belong (in case of the abiotic MS)
to two fundamental flux classes: <I>structural fluxes</I> (SF) and
<I>energy fluxes</I> (EF); in case of the biotic MS and for some
artificial MS, another basic flux class is added, that is the
<I>information fluxes</I> (IF).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The total amount of N types of
different fluxes, which are outward incident on RBS of a MS makes-up
the <I>set of the external influxes </I><FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61563;</FONT><B>F</B><SUB>EI</SUB><FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61565;</FONT>.
After the impact of these fluxes with RBS, other two flux sets occur
- the set of the external refluxes {<B>F</B><SUB>ER</SUB>} and the
set of the external trafluxes {<B>F</B><SUB>ET</SUB>}. On the inner
side of RBS, there will be another triad of the flux sets: {<B>F</B><SUB>II</SUB>}
the set of the internal influxes, {<B>F</B><SUB>IR</SUB>} the set of
the internal refluxes and {<B>F</B><SUB>IT</SUB>} the set of the
internal trafluxes. The set {<B>F</B><SUB>EF</SUB>} =
{<B>F</B><SUB>ER</SUB>}<IMG SRC="79_html_da51826.gif" NAME="Object431" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=13>{<B>F</B><SUB>IT</SUB>}makes-up
the set of efferent fluxes to MS. The fluxes which compose this set
<U>would not be able to exist if MS would not exist as well</U>, and
due to this reason, these fluxes are a basic indicator on the
existence of that particular MS and of its materiality. The set {<B>F</B><SUB>EF</SUB>}
also determines the amount of fields produced by MS.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the fluxes 
<IMG SRC="79_html_m58aa6b4b.gif" NAME="Object432" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=16>
are closed into the inner volume <I>V</I> of MS, any external traflux
of the same type as an existing internal flux, shall be composed
(vectorial summarization) with the internal flux, process which is
named the <I>internal </I>state change of MS. Once this change is
completed, the common attributes of the resulting flux shall
represent the <I>external </I>state change of MS. The temporal
interval which is required for this external state change is a
measure of the inertia property of MS, and the external state change
of a MS is called the <I>action</I> of that flux, referred to as
<I>agent flux</I>. The agent flux source is called the agent object
and MS subjected to the action exerted by the agent flux is referred
to as a <I>driven object.</I> We may say that an <I>interaction
</I>process occurs between two MS which deploy a mutual double and
simultaneous action process. If, as a result of this interaction
process, the inner attribute stock (transferred by fluxes) of the two
objects is maintained or is increased, that particular interaction is
<I>constructive.</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The qualitative property of a MS of
moving against a RS is called <I>energy</I>, and the energy quantity
(stockpile) owned by that MS is given by a relation between the
<I>energy capacitance</I> of a MS and an <I>attribute of external
energy state</I> of MS.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the flux means a collective and
specific motion process of a set of elementary objects, any material
flux requires the existence of an energy distributed on the flux&rsquo;s
basic material objects. If the flux is coherent open, this
distributed energy is a <I>kinetic energy</I>, whereas if the flux is
totally closed into a finite volume, the distributed energy is an
<I>internal energy</I> from that volume, and if the material flux is
stochastic and motionless, the energy contained in that flux is
referred to as <I>potential energy.</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The energy carried by a material flux,
detached from the other properties of the carrier objects represents
an <I>energy flux</I> (EF). The elementary energy amount contained by
a material flux element is an <I>energy quantum.</I> There are some
composition rules between the incident (agent) EF and EF stored
inside the MS (reaction flux) which are applied at the impact of an
EF with RBS of a MS:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">EF composition takes place
	exclusively on a RBS;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RBS transmittance for EF can never
	be null;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the coherent and collinear
	components of the interactive EF are being composed;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The composition process of the
	interactive EF takes place until the depletion of the resources of
	one of the fluxes;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the composition process,
	within the equilibrium state, the coherent equally and opposite
	fluxes can be converted (in some circumstances) either into
	stochastic fluxes or into closed coherent fluxes;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the completion of the
	composition process, when the equilibrium state vanishes, the
	remanent stored flux can be converted (in some circumstances) into a
	coherent flux.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The abstract
surface included into RBS volume, on which the agent and reaction
flux have equal and opposite flux density vectors (FDV) is named
<I>equilibrium surface,</I> and if this surface is motionless against
an outer reference, the state of the two antagonist fluxes is an
<I>equilibrium state.</I> The global variation of an EF incident on
RBS of MS is called <I>force</I>, and the density by surface of this
variation is called <I>pressure.</I> Under disequilibrium conditions
occurred between the agent and reaction EF, the energy amount
delivered by the agent EF to the driven system is proportional to the
equilibrium surface displacement, and it is named <I>mechanical work</I>.
The force which generates a mechanical work is an <I>active force</I>.</P>

<U>natural</U> formation and destruction of a MS, the objectual

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The material system is made-up for
	at least a partial coverage of the flux demand of its elements, by
	providing in this way the fulfillment of the flux demand of these

	formation, by means of a mutual flux delivery (import/export,
	re-circulation) between the elements.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The system&rsquo;s global flux
