7.2.2.1: Although it is quite unpleasant and boring, the
specification of all the denominations of the fluxes involved in the
transfer by means of RBS is important for the start, because in
certain papers, only some of these denominations are used, but since
we are talking about a general model, these denominations which are
specific to a certain professional domain, seem to be similar with
the others from other domains. Until the &ldquo;standardization&rdquo;
of a single denomination for each flux type, we have to mention all
of them. The category of <I>efferent</I> fluxes shall also include,
as we are about to see later on in this paper, the fluxes which are
not coming from the inside of volume V, but from its surface
(reflected fluxes); it is important that these reflected fluxes are
also open, with their direction oriented outward of volume V just
like the emergent fluxes, since they are output (divergent) fluxes as
well. If the reader has knowledge regarding the vector fields theory,
then he is able to instantly note that the two classes of input and
output fluxes (more exactly, their normal components on RBS) shall
have the divergence different from zero (positive or negative) and a
null curl, whereas the coherent components of the stored fluxes with
a non-zero circulation shall have a null divergence (through &Sigma;)
and a non-zero curl. In this way, the model of triad fluxes &ldquo;makes
a connection&rdquo; between the two basic flux classes (the ones with
a non-zero divergence and the ones with a non-zero curl) which seemed
to have no connection until this moment.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.2.2.2: For example, in case of humans, the water flux demand is
manifested through the signal given by the inner IPS expressed by the
sensation of thirst, with an intensity in proportion to the needed
flux amount (demand); after the completion of this amount, the flux
surplus is signaled by means of the satiety sensation. The same
situation occurs in case of the oxygen, food demand, so on, only the
signal given by inner IPS being different.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

the newly arisen MS is different from the reference medium which has
generated it (the medium which contains the generating set of the
structural elements of MS). When these fluxes vanish, the system
vanishes (dies) as well.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The common
properties of all MS are the ones resulted from the general model of
MS - the <I>fluxes triad model</I> (3<B>F</B> model). This model
settles that any MS has a finite inner volume which is separated by
the outside domain through a real bounding surface (RBS), which
contains the closed fluxes of MS. RBS is crossed in its both
directions by the other two flux categories of the model - input and
output fluxes. The existence of fluxes as distributed <U>motion</U>
processes determines the inseparable existence of a fundamental
property of MS, which represents the motion - <I>energy</I> <I>-</I>
and the existence of the stored fluxes (more exactly, of the
contained stocks) is a major factor for other fundamental properties
of MS - <I>spatial structure</I> and <I>inertia. </I>These
fundamental properties shall be analyzed later on and, for the time
being, we shall be dealing with RBS because it is very important that
this concept to be understood.</P>
