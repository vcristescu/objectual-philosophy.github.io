<H2 CLASS="western">7.1 Fluxes&rsquo; model</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since the ancient times, people have
noticed the motion of the surrounding objects, both of the single
objects and of the set of objects. The properties of the object&rsquo;s
motion have been identified and general laws have been released for
describing these motions. Even since the ancient Greek Era, the
scholars were aware that everything around us is a motion, either an
individual or a collective one. When the people found out that the
bodies have an inner structure based on atoms and molecules, it was
revealed that any motion of a solid body, liquid or a gas is a
collective motion, the same as the military maneuvers, animal herds
or bird flocks were. These collective motions are very obvious mostly
at the level of human society which was organized in families, clans,
tribes, nations etc. For those who were noticing the human activity,
it was very clear that there were collective movements (mostly
warriors who were attacking a nearby human settlement by taking all
its biotic and abiotic goods). After they have had enough of wars,
other collective movements were taking place between the same
settlements, which were represented by the exchange of the necessary
items (goods), objects which were either naturally (slaves, animals,
fruits, seeds etc.) or artificially (weapons, household objects etc.)
produced. We have seen in the previous chapters that these collective
(distributed) motions are called <I>fluxes.</I> Let us make a brief
review of the various organization levels of these fluxes which may
be seen in the real world.</P>
