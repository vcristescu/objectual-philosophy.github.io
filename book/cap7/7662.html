7.6.6.2.1: A coherent, apparently continuous, photon flux, such as
the one generated by a continuous laser, actually consists in a very
large amount of energy quanta - individual photons with energy <I>E=
hv</I>. The overall action of the flux (laser beam) means an addition
of the individual and finite actions of each incident photon on RBS
of the driven body. There is a similar situation in case of a gas or
liquid jet which hit the surface of a body, the overall action being
the result of cumulating the individual energy stockpiles of all the
individual molecules wich collide on the surface of the driven body.
In case of solid body collision, the total action is the same
cumulative stock of all elements, each bringing its contribution by
means of its kinetic energy stockpile quantum and this quantum being
the result of the kinetic energy distribution of the body along its
inner elements. In case of the action exerted by an energy field to a
body placed in this field, the energy flux which is transmitted to
the body is the result of the variation of incident elementary energy
fluxes on the body&rsquo;s RBS, and the action&rsquo;s result (state
change of the driven body) is due to the addition (integration) of
these individual actions along the entire RBS. Each element of the
medium which is the material support of the energy field owns an
energy quantum, but the magnitude of this quantum does not
necessarily have the same value (as in the classic quantic physics)
but on the contrary, within the media with uneven energy distribution
(radial fields), the energy stockpile per element of each medium is
variable with the spatial position of the element against its field
source.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
