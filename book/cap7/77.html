<H2 CLASS="western">7.7 The fundamental classes of inner fluxes</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the
concepts which were introduced so far, such as <I>distribution,
object, process, flux</I>, and based on the current public available
knowledge, we may note that any material system has a <I>spatial
structure</I> with a specific number of elements and invariant
attributes, therefore, we are dealing with a complex object, with an
inner RS against which the elements&rsquo; properties are invariant,
that is a structure made-up from other objects as well, and these
objects have also an invariant inner structure, so on, aspects which
have been also postulated by the <I>systemic organization principle</I>
(SOP), presented in chapter 1.</P>

7.7.1: The <I>spatial structure</I> term has a broader meaning
according to the objectual philosophy, being synonym with the spatial
distribution of the elements belonging to a MS. If it is clear that
the geometrical S-type systems (lines, figures, pol<SPAN LANG="en-US">y</SPAN>hedra
etc.) own a spatial (structure) distribution which is invariant as
regards the components&rsquo; position (both T and R), this aspect is
no longer valid for L and G-type distributed MS. However, even in
case of these latter types of MS, there are spatial distributions
with an invariant character (besides the distributions of atoms,
molecules or &ldquo;clusters&rdquo;) which have invariant inner
references and are also considered in this paper as objects with a
spatial structure, but this time, these objects are <U>closed fluxes</U>
(namely, objects which are in motion inside MS) and not objects with
an invariant spatial position. These fluxes are closed in a limited
space with invariant boundaries (enclosure which contains that
particular medium), there is an invariant reference direction (local
direction of the gravitational field), a masscenter and a pressure
center (with invariant position if the enclosure&rsquo;s position and
shape are invariant as well). As compared to these reference
elements, the mean statistical attributes of the inner fluxes are
kept invariant (if the external conditions are invariant as well),
therefore, these attributes will make-up a state (inner) object of
MS. In chapter 5, we have also seen that, spatially speaking, the
overall state of a flux at a specific moment is represented by Euler
distribution of FDV, that is a distribution which is invariant in
case of the stationary fluxes. But an invariant spatial distribution
means also a spatial structure, even we are dealing with the
configuration of a vector field.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The invariant
attributes of the spatial structure of a specific MS are also
maintained due to the fact that the structure attributes of the
constitutive objects are invariant (in other words, these elements
are objects as well), and there are invariant spatial relations
against an inner overall RS of MS deployed between the inner
reference systems of these components. In chapter 4, we have noticed
that the <I>state</I>-type abstract objects are divided in processual
classes, that the objects with null processes have states belonging
to class<I> S</I><SUB><I>0</I></SUB>, and the invariant attributes of
the processes make-up objects from the classes <I>S</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB><I>,
S</I><SUB><I>2</I></SUB> so on. We have also noticed that the fluxes
are processes, therefore, their invariant attributes make-up
processual abstract objects, which are distributions with spatial,
temporal or frequency support of these attributes. Based on the
aforementioned issues and on the generic MS model proposed by the
objectual philosophy, it clearly results that if there are specific
amount fluxes inside a MS, this means that we shall have support
objects of that particular moving amounts; since their motion occurs
only inside a RBS of a MS, this motion also means some <I>closed
fluxes</I> deployed in the volume occupied by MS, fluxes which must
have some invariant attributes in order to form processual objects.</P>

7.7.2: For instance, the peripheral medium of an atom, made-up only
from electrons, has a rigid structure (but not at the level of the
electrons&rsquo; position but at the level of the orbitals occupied
by these electrons), which means that it is a S-type DS (more
exactly, S<SUB>R</SUB>-type, in which the constitutive elements are
maintained despite of the presumed repulsion deployed between them,
by the powerful electric interaction with the core subsystem - the
nucleus with its positive charges). The main argument which explains
this stiffness is that, if it would not be so, neither the crystals,
which are also S-type DS, created by means of covalent or ionic bonds
(interactions) between the atoms&rsquo; peripheral electrons, would
be able to exist (no bonds with preferential, invariant directions
would be able to exist). Within this electronic medium, each
electronic orbital has (under a non-disturbed state) unique and
invariant state attributes (whose existential attributes make-up the
so-called set of quantum numbers), although each of these electrons
performs plenty of motions (therefore, they are fluxes). This means
that the quantum numbers which define the state of a specific
electron are quantitative attributes of some invariant processual
qualitative attributes, namely, parameters of some invariant fluxes.
Since we are referring to fluxes which are objects set in motion, it
is clear that the moving object&rsquo;s position (electron) is
non-determined, but instead, we may define the invariant attributes
for the object&rsquo;s velocity (with its equivalent that is the
energy or the orbital frequency), for the spatial distribution of the
flux lines (plane, radius, and orbital axis, the position of axis and
orbital plane against an atomic RS, which coincides with the nuclear
one), distance of the orbital plane towards the nucleus (that is
invariant in case of a specific electronic layer). Therefore, if we
cannot define the position of an electron, we can define instead the
position of the <I>orbital</I> on which it may be placed (the orbital
means an abstract object which gathers all the invariant attributes
of the individual electronic flux, which were above mentioned). The
reader is invited to observe that S-type systems can be also made-up
from fluxes (naturally, from closed, coherent and invariant fluxes),
if the spatial parameters of these fluxes (the invariant ones) are
able to meet the conditions of S-type systems, characterized by
permanent interaction and the restriction of <U>free</U> translation
and rotation of the elements (elements which this time are the
above-mentioned invariant fluxes).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We may note that the inner structure of
a MS, based on fluxes, is generally made-up from a set of support
objects of the conveying or storing properties and from an &ldquo;agent&rdquo;
which sets in motion these objects in order to produce inner fluxes.
The &ldquo;agent&rdquo; which generates the motion and which is
called <I>energy flux</I>, according to the objectual philosophy, was
minutely presented in the previous sections. Now, we are most
interested in the support objects found inside a MS.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the generation of a motion (flux)
of a material object, besides the energy which is required for the
motion, a space for this motion is also needed, that is a space which
will confine the resulted flux. In other words, each flux from the
set of inner fluxes with simultaneous existence belonging to a MS
needs a spatial resource for its existence. The total amount, the
union, either disjoint or partly conjoint, of these spatial resources
needed for the inner fluxes (defined against the inner RS of MS)
shall make-up the total space occupied by that particular MS, namely,
the system&rsquo;s inner spatial range (domain).</P>

7.7.3: For example, the case of the specific components of the
individual (orbital) fluxes of the electrons from the peripheral
electronic medium of the isolated atoms, where, as it was mentioned
in the previous comment, the spatial domains of the orbitals must be
disjoint because the flux&rsquo;s state attributes (quantum numbers)
are different. It is not the same situation in case of two (or more)
atoms linked through covalent bonds, in which case the electrons
involved in the bond (the valence or conduction electrons of the two
linked atoms) must have a <U>partly conjoint</U> spatial domains of
the orbitals (their intersection must be non-void). If do you
remember what it was said in the previous sections about RBS with
spatio-temporal distribution (such as the case of RBS generated by an
electron placed on a specific orbital), and about the synchronism
required to a constructive interaction, then, it clearly results the
reason why two electrons which are connected in a covalent bond
(electrons which in the current papers are denoted as &ldquo;commonly
used&rdquo; by the bound atoms) must have synchronic and co-phasal
orbital frequencies, at least at the harmonics level, fact which
determines the necessity of orbital interpenetration (conjunction).
This argument is valid for any kind of molecule with covalent bonds,
but it is more obvious in case of the metallic bonds, where the
&ldquo;massive&rdquo; conjunction of the atoms&rsquo; outer orbitals
makes that the electrons placed on this orbitals to be able to
&ldquo;migrate&rdquo; from an orbital to another during the process
of electric current conduction.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the MS as a whole shall be moving
against an outer reference, we shall have an overall flux (of all the
inner elements of MS), that is a flux which also needs a spatial
resource, a space in which that motion to be possible. Because the
inner space of MS is its minimum spatial resource, which is necessary
even if the MS is motionless, we may also call it as the system&rsquo;s
<I>rest space</I>. As we have noticed in the section focused on
energy, the inner energy of a MS is stored in the rest space, that is
an energy which is even named <I>rest energy</I>, in case of EP
considered to be motionless against a RS.</P>

7.7.4: <B>Attention!</B> When we talk about the rest energy of an EP,
by taking into account the energy definition from the section 7.6.1,
it is clear that at least one MS flux must exist in the inner domain
of EP, flux which contains this inner energy of the particle inside
it. The existence of this stored flux is also required by the general
MS model (3<B>F</B> model), the stored flux being the source of the
emergent fluxes produced by the particle (electric, gravitational
flux etc.).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The debate which was made so far on the
necessary spatial resources of the inner objects and fluxes of a MS
is explained by the justification of the fact that <U>each MS</U>,
regardless if it is abiotic, biotic or artificial, has a spatial
distribution of its properties (rigid, namely invariant for the S
systems and fluid for the others), and that this distribution is
possible only due to the simultaneous existence of the <U>spatial
distributions of the inner components</U> of MS and due to the
<U>spatial distributions of the fluxes</U> which involve this
components. At the moment of a MS formation, each component will
contribute with its own spatial structure at the future aggregate
structure of the new MS, otherwise speaking, <U>the necessity that
any MS to have a spatial structure</U> requires <U>the necessity of
the external contribution of some spatial structure elements</U>.
Obviously, the motion necessity of these structural elements also
draws the need of an energy component existence.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all the aspects mentioned so far
in this section, the result is that the total amount of the inner
fluxes necessary for a MS consists of two major flux classes:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="struct_flux"></A>Fluxes
	of spatial structure elements, which shall be shortly named
	<I><B>structural fluxes</B></I> (SF);</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fluxes able to convey motion to
	these elements (to set them in motion or to maintain the motion in
	order to generate and maintain the vital fluxes), fluxes which are
	named <I><B>energy fluxes</B></I> (EF), as we have seen in a
	previous section.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">It is clear that
the fluxes triad model postulates the fact that, if the inner fluxes
of a MS belong to these two above-mentioned classes, both the input
fluxes (which must cover the inner flux demand) and the output fluxes
(which are coming from the inner fluxes) of a MS will also belong to
these two basic flux classes.</P>

7.7.5: For example, in case of the atomic MS, the structural fluxes
(made-up from protons, neutrons and electrons) are provided during
the system&rsquo;s formation (synthesis) process, its structure being
subsequently invariant (if nuclear disintegration or ionization
processes do not occur), so that the further demand for an input flux
is valid only for the energy fluxes, which must maintain all the
inner motion types, and to compensate the losses (exclusive energetic
fluxes) through output fluxes (fields of an atom). However, there is
a different situation in case of the bio-systems or artificial MS,
where the structural elements of the system may be degraded
throughout time (they have a shorter existence as compared to the
system&rsquo;s life span), consequently, the input fluxes must
contain, besides the compulsory energy flows, some fluxes of
structural elements as well (which shall replace the damaged ones). A
non-used part from the input structural fluxes or from the structural
fluxes generated as a result of elements degradation shall be
discharged through the output structural fluxes (in case of the
bio-systems, that is the excretion function). It is obvious that the
processes which generate a new system must contain both energy fluxes
and massive structural fluxes which are needed during the development
(growth or synthesis) stage of the new system.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is worth noticing that the two basic
components of the inner fluxes may be found at the same type of input
or output flux. For instance, the food ingested by a human contains
both structural elements (e.g.: elements required for the synthesis
of proteins or of other elements from the cells&rsquo; structure),
and a certain part of the energy fluxes contained (confined) in the
structure of some organic molecules, fluxes which will be released as
a result of the enzyme decay of these molecules inside the cells, by
providing in this way the intracellular energy resources.</P>
