7.2.4 The fluxes transfer through RBS</H3>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The transfer
processes of the fluxes through real surfaces are much more complex
than the transfer through the theoretical surfaces. A mathematic
model of these processes may be conceived, as I have mentioned above,
by taking into consideration the real surface of a medium as a zone
(space) placed between two parallel theoretical surfaces, at such
distance, so that all the dynamic transfer processes to be able to
occur in the interval between them.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Fig. 7.2.4.1</I></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">We shall take into
account the medium <I>M</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB><SUB> </SUB>placed

The real surface which limits <I>V</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB> is
considered to be composed from two theoretical surfaces 
<IMG SRC="724_html_68b31e89.gif" NAME="Object258" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=24>
and 
<IMG SRC="724_html_5a604457.gif" NAME="Object259" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=24>,
which are parallel at the distance <I>d</I>, with the normal lines <I><B>n</B></I><SUB><I>I</I></SUB>
and <I><B>n</B></I><SUB><I>E</I></SUB> (figure 7.2.4.1 displays only
a small fraction from RBS, so that we may assume that the two virtual
surfaces are plane and orthogonal on the figure plane).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Volume <I>V</I><SUB><I>T</I></SUB><I>
</I>(transition space of the real surface) shall be placed between
these surfaces, with its sizes imposed by the distance <I>d</I> and
with the mean statistic attributes which are gradually variable, so
that the parameters of the external medium <I>M</I><SUB><I>E</I></SUB>
to be found on the surface 
<IMG SRC="724_html_5a604457.gif" NAME="Object260" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=24>

to be found on the surface 
<IMG SRC="724_html_68b31e89.gif" NAME="Object261" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=24>.
This construction shall be the reference against which an <I>interior</I>
of the system (volume <I>V</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB>) and an <I>exterior</I>
(volume <I>V</I><SUB><I>E</I></SUB>) shall be defined. Through this
RBS, the fluxes exchange between the medium M<SUB>1 </SUB>and the
outer medium shall occur. For the description of these fluxes, a
notation scheme with two indexes <I>x</I> and <I>y </I>(<B>F</B><SUB><I>xy</I></SUB>)
shall be displayed, thus:</P>
<UL>

</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We shall have therefore six types of

sign convention (and accordingly, the normal lines direction) has the
following configuration: for each of the media M<SUB><I>E</I></SUB><I>
</I>or<I> </I>M<SUB><I>1</I></SUB>, <I>there are positive fluxes
which have the direction of that normal line </I>(in other words, in
case of the external medium, the fluxes with <B>n</B><SUB><I>E</I></SUB>
direction are positive because these fluxes lead to a stock increase
in this medium, similarly with <I>M</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB>). One may
notice that the surface 
<IMG SRC="724_html_5a604457.gif" NAME="Object262" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=24>
may be considered as the theoretical surface of the medium <I>M</I><SUB><I>E</I></SUB>,
therefore, the positive fluxes through this surface generate a stock
increase in <I>M</I><SUB><I>E</I></SUB><SUB>, </SUB>as well as 
<IMG SRC="724_html_68b31e89.gif" NAME="Object263" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=24>,
which may be considered as a theoretical surface for <I>M</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB>,
with the same sign convention.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the fluxes are distributions,
due to simplicity and clarity reasons, they have been displayed
through a single vector which represents the entire vector
distribution on the effective flux section (the displayed vector is
therefore the resultant vector of this distribution, more exactly, it
is the resultant vector of the flux&rsquo;s coherent component along
that particular direction). Under these conditions, the six possible
fluxes are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>F</B><SUB><I>EI</I></SUB>,
	<U>in</U>cident external flux (with the denomination used in this

</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The incident external fluxes (outer
influxes), <B>F</B><SUB><I>EI</I></SUB>, shall enter into the
transition space V<SUB>T</SUB> and they will be subjected to the
<I>de(composition) </I>processes. A part of these fluxes will
traverse volume V<SUB>T</SUB> by leaving its source medium and will
penetrate the medium <I>M</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB> (outer traflux <B>F</B><SUB><I><B>ET</B></I></SUB>),
the rest of the flux being reflected (outer reflux <B>F</B><SUB><I>ER</I></SUB>)
and remaining into the source medium. One may notice that there are
two types of incident fluxes - internal or external - according to
their origin coming from the inner or the outer medium. The transfer
processes for the inner incident fluxes are absolutely similar, only
the indexes being different.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six main fluxes which occur on the
RBS of a MS may be also divided in two components each:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normal component (with the normal
	line direction <B>n</B><SUB><I><B>E</B></I></SUB> or <B>n</B><SUB><I><B>I</B></I></SUB><B>
	</B>);</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tangential component (according to

	</B>included in the two tangent planes).</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each component shall be associated to a
coherent flux towards a particular direction. Finally, the mathematic
model of the flux transfer through RBS of a MS shall therefore
include twelve fluxes for each type of flux from the panoply of <I>k
</I>fluxes of a certain MS.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is worth mentioning that this
decomposition and re-composition of fluxes take place in the entire
volume <I>V</I><SUB><I>T</I></SUB> , being actually a vector fields
composition - the fields which represent the incident fluxes and the
fields which represent the reaction fluxes of the medium inside the
transition space.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The total amount of <I>k</I> types of
different qualitative fluxes, incident from the outside on a RBS
belonging to a MS, makes-up the <I>external influxes set</I>, which
shall be noted with <FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61563;</FONT><B>F</B><SUB>EI</SUB><FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61565;</FONT>,
(the set of all the open fluxes which are outside of the system,
crossing the spatial domain occupied by the system). After the
contact of these fluxes with RBS, other two sets of fluxes are
generated - the set of the external refluxes {<B>F</B><SUB>ER</SUB>},
and the set of the external trafluxes {<B>F</B><SUB>ET</SUB>}.
Another triad of the fluxes set shall be developed on the inner side
of RBS: {<B>F</B><SUB><I><B>II</B></I></SUB>}, set of the inner
influxes, {<B>F</B><SUB><I><B>IR</B></I></SUB>}, set of the inner
refluxes and {<B>F</B><SUB><I><B>IT</B></I></SUB>}, set of the inner
trafluxes (towards outside of MS).</P>

the set of the <I><B>fluxes efferent</B></I> to MS. The fluxes which
compose this set <U>would not be able to exist if MS with its RBS
would not exist</U>. Due to this reason, these fluxes are a basic
indicator of MS <I>existence</I> (at its spatial location),
respectively of its materiality, as we are about to see in chapter 8.</P>

7.2.4.1: As for the fluxes reflected by a MS, various comments on its
origin (source) may be made; indeed, a radiant flux such as an
electromagnetic wave released by the aerial of a radar has clearly
its source in this aerial (more precisely, in the radiator from focus
of the aerial), but we might say that the beam which is reflected by
an object (target) has the source in that object, because that flux
comes from out there. If the reflecting object with its RBS would not
have existed at that location, a reflected wave would not have
existed either. Therefore, we may assert that if the radar aerial is
the source of the incident flux on the target surface, the target
itself is the source of the reflected flux.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

Unlike the refluxes, which are not able to exist unless some influxes
are present, the fluxes {<B>F</B><SUB>IT</SUB>} coming from inside
the system can exist for a limited period of time <U>even in the
absence of the input fluxes</U>, but only until the depletion of the
fluxes which are stored inside (of the flux resources). This
duration, which depends on the amount of the inner <I>k</I>-type flux
stock, is called <I><B>a relative life span related to the k-type
flux</B></I> of the system (see also the annex X.16).</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We may note that a MS generates so many
field types, as many flux types are coming from its interior, or as
many are reflected by its surface. Since these are open (active)
fluxes, they can produce actions on other external MS, as we are
about to see in a future section of this paper.</P>

7.2.4.2: Not only the inner trafluxes of a MS are field generators,
but also the outer refluxes. When we see the light reflected by a
body, we are able to capture part of this photonic field generated
through the reflection on object&rsquo;s RBS, of a photon flux
released from the source. The major difference between the two fields
is mentioned above: the reflected field exist only in the presence of
an incident flux, whereas the field generated by an inner traflux is
able to exist without any external contribution, and the most
important fact, coming from the inside, is that it carries to the
outside, information about the inner state of the releasing MS,
information which are for those who know how to interpret it.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The efferent fluxes from a MS are
carriers of some properties of MS where they come from (source MS)
and they can be used as a information support for the systems able to
intercept and process these fluxes - information processing systems -
which shall be described in the following chapter.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
7.2.4.3: For example, in case of the bio-systems belonging to the
class of herbivorous mammals (but not only) there is an emergent
molecular flux running through the epidermis pores - perspiration -
that is a flux which is spread in the air as a result of the
vaporization of the water from its composition. The concentration of
these molecules which are dispersed in the support air, depends on
the direction of the air motions and on the distance towards the
issuing animal, the spatial-temporal distribution of this
concentration making-up the odorous field of that animal. The
chemical composition of this flux is perceived by the olfactory
organs of the nearby animals, mostly by the carnivorous animals, for
which the herbivorous animals are the main food source. This
composition depends on the inner processes deployed by the issuing
animal, therefore, it releases to the outside information about the
age, health condition, current &ldquo;psychic&rdquo; state (fear,
aggressiveness) of the source, which are essential information for
predatories in order to choose their next victim. The perception of
the odorous field of animals is for the carnivorous animals the main
source of remote information regarding the nearby presence of a
potential prey, and the sight sense is used only at a short range
(for guiding the hunting process).  Due also to this reason, (so that
their presence cannot be traced), some carnivorous animals (such as
the canines, felines) have reduced to the lowest level their own
odour flux by blocking the involuntary perspiration (through the
skin), this process being mainly produced through the oral cavity
(voluntary).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
