<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Let us consider the more simple case of
a MS with a single type of stored flux (<I>k=1</I>), that is the
kinetic flux (whose FDV is <I>
<IMG SRC="73_html_mb347b27.gif" NAME="Object279" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=20></I>,
where <I>&rho;</I> is the mass density). Before the action of an
outer flux (of the same kind), the system has a specific inner flux
which is stored inside the inner volume defined by RBS, that is the
source where the emergent (with losses) flux of MS is coming from.
The flux which is stored inside MS has a specific <I>state</I>
(defined both in the chapter focused on processes and in the chapter
about fluxes), both against the inner reference of MS, and against an
outer reference, state which will determine the behavior (motion
types) of MS against the outer reference. If the internally stored
flux has a common component, with FDV <SUB><I>
<IMG SRC="73_html_5cfcaac6.gif" NAME="Object280" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=24></I></SUB>
against an outer reference, MS shall have a global motion of velocity
<IMG SRC="73_html_3a29f392.gif" NAME="Object281" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=24>,
and if this common component is null, MS shall have an invariant
position against the outer reference. At the moment of the incidence
of an external flux (that is also kinetic) on RBS of MS, the
component of this flux which is conveyed through RBS (outer traflux)
shall be composed with the previously-existent inner flux, that is a
composition of two vectorial fields, which will generate the new
state of the stored flux.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This <I>process</I> of state variation
is produced by strictly complying with the causality law, which means
that the flux which is internally stored as a result of an action,
shall be an effect (a result) of the existence and accumulation of
the immergent (inflow) flux which is added to the previously stored
flux. Consequently, an immergent flux (agent flux) shall produce
<U>first of all</U> changes in the inner medium of MS (modification
of the inner state) and then, an external state change (&ldquo;visible&rdquo;
from the outside) shall take place. The outer state of MS is given by
the <I><B>common component</B></I> of the individual states of MS
elements, states which were modified as a result of this action
(composition of the immergent flux with the previously stored flux).</P>

7.3.1: For example, at the collision of two inert gas atoms (e.g.:
neon gas), each atom which is moving is the equivalent with an open
flux of constant effective section - the overall kinetic flux
(impulse) - generated by the coherent T component (translation motion
of the atomic inner T reference), which is the common component of
all the motions of the atom&rsquo;s inner elements. In other words,
the translation motion with an even velocity is the outer state of
the two atoms before the interaction occurrence. The two MS shall
interact at the level of the atomic RBS made-up from the outer layers
of the atomic electrons. Here, the two external incident fluxes shall
be composed and decomposed according to the transfer rules by means
of RBS, resulting pairs of incident, reflected and transmitted fluxes
against the local reference (normal line and tangent plane at RBS in
the impact zone of the two fluxes). Each flux conveyed to the inside
of each atom, shall produce state changes first into the outer
electronic medium (compression of the electronic medium from the
impact area), and afterwards, it will change the state of the atomic
kernels (followed by their motion towards the direction of the
kinetic flux generated by this composition). The atoms ensemble shall
be moving after the collision (the &ldquo;visible&rdquo; external
change) just after the completion of these transitory flux transfer
processes exerted on the entire atomic inner structure. Finally, the
motion generated as a result of the atom&rsquo;s collision
interaction (the new fluxes resulted from the interaction process)
shall be composed from two coherent kinetic fluxes (of the atoms
after the collision). We have selected in this example two inert gas
atoms due to regularity (spherical isotropy) of the electronic RBS
for this kind of atoms, fact which simplifies the interaction
process, the tangential components being reduced in this case (the
equivalent of the elastic collisions between two balls).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If more external fluxes of the same
kind exert a simultaneous impact on MS, the change of the external
state shall be produced in the same way as the above-mentioned one,
namely according to the direction of the common component of these
fluxes (the resultant vector direction); if this common component is
null (so-called equilibrium state), there is no external component
which was generated for the output fluxes. Even maybe it is not
necessary, we must remind that: in order to produce an action, the
agent flux must be an <U>open flux</U>, whose flux lines would
intersect RBS of the driven MS, and RBS to be permeable to that type
of flux.</P>

7.3.2: The definition 7.3.5 contains the semantic value of the
interaction notion in the &ldquo;more sensitive&rdquo; case of the
remote interactions, through the fields generated by two MS. However,
the same definition is also valid in case of the direct interactions
(e.g.: by means of collision), therefore, we are dealing with a
reciprocal flux exchange between two MS.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.3.3: Because it is always about a pair of fluxes, the utilization
of the notion&rsquo;s singular (that is interactive flux) does not
make sense, so neither does the interaction notion when we are
dealing with an isolated MS.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Therefore, there is a double and
simultaneous action process deployed in the interaction process, in
which each of the MS that is part of this couple is at the same time
an agent object <U>on</U> its partner and object driven <U>by the</U>
pair partner. Any interaction process, no matter how complex it is,
may be decomposable in bilateral interactions between MS couples.</P>

7.3.4 This way of defining the concepts of <I>action </I>and
<I>interaction</I>, which is specific to the objectual philosophy
allows a proper understanding of all the interaction types which are
found in the real world, both regarding the &ldquo;physical&rdquo;
interactions between the abiotic systems, and the informational
interactions between the biotic systems, ending with the complex
political, military, economic interactions deployed between the state
systems or (why not?) between the planetary social systems. If the
first interaction types (the &ldquo;physical&rdquo; ones) have almost
exclusively the energy fluxes as agent fluxes, in case of the
bio-systems and systems made-up from bio-systems, the interactions
are generated both by the energy and structural fluxes, and mostly by
the informational fluxes which are made-up from the information
support systems (ISS which shall be minutely approached in chapter
8).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the current language, there is a
difference between the abiotic and biotic world also concerning the
notion of <I>state change</I> as a result of an action. If within the
abiotic field, this change meant the variation of a physical state
attribute (motion, temperature, pressure, etc.), according to the
biotic field, the successive, external, &ldquo;visible&rdquo; state
variations of a bio-system (the driven object) make-up its <I>behavior
</I>as a result (effect) of the agent flux action, behavior which is
characterized both by the physical components (motions, form and
temperature changes, etc.), and by psychic components (changes in the
field of the information fluxes which are stored inside the
bio-system&rsquo;s IPS, which lead to changes of <I>psychic state</I>).</P>
<P>As for the &ldquo;visibility&rdquo; of
the state change, the aspects are similar both for the abiotic MS and
for the biotic MS: &ldquo;visible&rdquo; (observable by an outer IPS)
may be considered those actions which produce changes in the <I>efferent
</I>fluxes of the driven object, these fluxes being the unique
support of the information on that particular object. There is also
the additional request that the fluxes efferent to a MS to be
included in the perception range of IPS, but all of these issues
shall be minutely presented in chapter 8.</P>
