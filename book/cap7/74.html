<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">7.4 Interaction
of the material systems</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Taking into account
a simple case, a group of two material systems MS<SUB>1</SUB> and MS<SUB>2</SUB>
which are displayed in the figure 7.4.1, in which the circles
represent the real bounding surfaces of the systems against the
outside medium M<SUB>e</SUB>, the arrows pointed on the circles are
outer influxes, the arrows pointed on the outside are inner trafluxes
(emergent, export fluxes), and the bent arrows from the inside
represent (symbolically) the fluxes of each material system which are
internally stored.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Fig. 7.4.1</I></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">For simplifying the
figure, the arrows which symbolize both the outer influx and the
inner traflux (emergent fluxes), must be considered as resultants
along the direction of respective continuous distributions on RBS, of
the FDV specific to the incident fluxes on RBS, and also emergent
through RBS. From all the external influxes, only a fraction shall
penetrate inside MS, the rest being reflected (returned to M<SUB>e</SUB>).
This part from the outer incident fluxes, the transmitted fluxes
(import flux, external traflux) shall be added (vectorial
summarization) to the initial stockpile of inner fluxes and,
according to the sign of this sum, this stockpile shall be increased
(compensating in this way the losses produced by means of the export
fluxes), or shall be decreased.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: #f2f2f2; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.01in 0.06in"><A NAME="cons_inter"></A>
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Definition
7.4.1:</B> The interaction which conserve or increase the inner flux
stockpile of the interacting material systems (despite the losses due
to the emergent fluxes) is named <B>constructive interaction.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Obviously, there is
also a situation when, as a result of the interaction, the inner flux
stockpile of the involved MS drops, that is why we are dealing with a
<I>destructive interaction.</I> Next, we are about to see that, for
the formation of a stable MS, the interactions between its elements
must be strictly constructive.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">By analyzing the
figure 7.4.1, it might be noticed that a specific MS is under the
incidence of fluxes coming both from the outside of the unit (namely,
from the outside of the theoretical surface &Sigma; which surrounds
the unit) and from the neighbour system. In this way, flux pairs
reciprocally provided by MS may be observed. Due to simplicity
reasons, we may consider that the fluxes released by the two MS are
of the same kind (<I>k=1</I>), and RBS transmittance for this flux
type of the two MS involved in the interaction processes are equal
and of same value <I>p</I>. Therefore, we shall have:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>F</B><SUB><I>12</I></SUB>,
	emergent flux (export) of MS<SUB>1</SUB> and incident on MS<SUB>2</SUB>,
	out of which <I>p</I><B>F</B><SUB><I>12</I></SUB> shall be
	transmitted inside MS<SUB>2</SUB>;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>F</B><SUB><I>21</I></SUB>,
	emergent (export) flux of MS<SUB>2</SUB> and incident on MS<SUB>1</SUB>,
	out of which <I>p</I><B>F</B><SUB><I>21</I></SUB> shall be
	transmitted inside MS<SUB>1</SUB>.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The flux <I>p</I><B>F</B><SUB><I>12</I></SUB>
shall be composed (vectorial summarization) with the flux 
<IMG SRC="74_html_66f54627.gif" NAME="Object283" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=24>,
and the flux <I>p</I><B>F</B><SUB><I>21</I></SUB> with 
<IMG SRC="74_html_54e7ff00.gif" NAME="Object284" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>,
that is a composition which must met several rules:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The composition of some
	distributions means the individual composition between all its
	constitutive elements (which makes-up interactive couples) of the
	two distributions, which means that the flux which is recently
	transmitted must be assigned (distributed) to <U>all</U> the
	elements of the previously stored flux.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The external state of MS (the
	action component which is &ldquo;visible from the outside&rdquo;) is
	given by the common components of the flux resulted from the
	composition. Otherwise speaking, the driven MS is an object with an
	inner RS, and the outer state of this object is actually the state
	of the inner RS against the outer RS. Because the inner RS is unique
	for a MS, the state attributes of this RS shall be evenly
	distributed on all the MS elements, which means that they would be
	common attributes of these elements.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flux composition conditions,
correlated with the fact that the internally stored flux has a set of
material objects which interact one another (a DS or CS) as its
material support, tell us that <U>a finite temporal interval</U> is
needed for this composition process, and that <U>during this
interval</U>, the <U>external</U> state of MS <U>does not change</U>
(the state before the inflow of the flux agent is maintained)<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>4</SUP></A>1.
The fact that the external state of a MS cannot be instantly changed,
that it must be preceded by the internal state change and that a
finite temporal interval is needed for this process, is a basic
property of the material systems which is very clearly revealed by
considering the flux triad model, more precisely, by the compulsory
existence of the fluxes which are internally stored for each MS.
Another very relevant aspect is that during the period necessary for
the inner state change, the driven MS withstand to the agent flux, by
means of an opposition manifested through a contrary flux deployed
against the agent flux - <I>reaction flux</I> - which shall be
described later on in this paper (see also annex X.7).</P>

	the elements of the internally stored flux would have been composed
