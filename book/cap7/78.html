<H2 CLASS="western">7.8 Formation laws of the natural material
systems</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First of all, an explanation on the
title of this section is required. Beside the natural MS, there are
also the artificial MS, whose components are the natural MS (which
comply with the laws in question), but which are regulated by
additional rules beside the formation laws of the natural MS, in
order to achieve the functionality of the artificial system. These
types of artificial MS are not self-composed depending on the medium
conditions (they can be self-decomposed though), but they are
composed by a material system which owns an IPS. However, in case of
the natural MS, the objectual philosophy proposes an invariant set of
rules, coming from a series of experimental facts described by the
technical-scientific literature, rules which establish both the
formation conditions (synthesis, composition) of MS and also their
destruction (decay) conditions.</P>

	within the medium, so that the outer traflux achieved through RBS is
	not able to cover the element&rsquo;s flux demand. Therefore, the

	than the offer of flux provided by an element with which an

7.8.1: In order to show the validity of this law, only two examples
will be given, one from the field of abiotic MS and one from the
biotic field. <I>Example 1</I> <I>-</I> The material systems
belonging to AT class are able to create, by means of association
with an extremel<SPAN LANG="en-US">y</SPAN> large number of elements,
distributed systems, which in this paper are named <I>natural media</I>
(NM). In their turn, these NM make-up large spheroidal aggregates
which are the astronomical bodies (AB) - stars, planets, large
satellites etc. Based on the knowledge level reached so far, we know
that within this AB is a non-even radial distribution of the pressure
and temperature, distribution which starts at very low values (the
ones reached at the upper limit of the AB atmosphere), but which
reaches very high values in the centre of AB. Since the pressure and
temperature are attributes which depend on the flux density of some
energy fluxes, the higher their values, the unfavorable are the
formation conditions of MS made-up from atoms. At certain depths, the
melting (destruction of the crystalline systems) of the surface solid
NM is initiated, together with the atomic dissociation (ionization
with the occurrence of the electric conductibility), and in the
center of very large AB (such as the stars), the medium&rsquo;s
energy flux density is that high so that even the atomic kernels are
decomposed. Therefore, the high outer flux inputs of the environment
encourage the existence of the singular elements (non-associated),
whereas the deficit (lack) of energy flux encourages the association
of elements within systems. Due to these reasons, at the periphery of
the AB, where the flux density is low, the non-dissociated atoms are
linked one another, by making-up the non-dissociated S and L-type
media. Within these peripheral media (more exactly in L-type media) a
generation of biotic systems has occurred (also as a result of
conditions which were favorable to their development). <I>Example 2</I>
<I>-</I> The unicellular animal <I>Dictyostelium discoideium</I>, an
eukaryote which lives in the moist forest ground as a motile cell
also known as <I>amoeba</I> who is feeding with bacteria and fungus,
has a division cycle of several hours, under food abundance
conditions. When the food resources are low, the division is blocked
and the organisms are associated in worm-shaped structures with about
1..2 mm in length, made-up from about 10<SUP>5</SUP> specimens. Each
structure behaves totally different as compared to the free amoebae:
it is extremely sensitive to light and heat and migrates towards
these sources (in other words, it turns into account any available
energy source). During the migration, the cells are differentiated by
producing an organism which resembles (in terms of shape) with a
plant (also known as <I>fruiting body</I>). This new organism
contains a large amount of spores which are able to live in hostile
environment conditions for long periods of time. The spore cells are
covered by a protective cellulose layer and afterwards, all the
organism&rsquo;s cells, except the spores, are dying. The spores
germinate, if only favorable conditions for the amoeba<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym" SDFIXED><SUP>5</SUP></A>8</FONT>

7.8.2 For a better apprehension of this law, the most appropriate
examples are taken from the field of MS which release fluxes with
opposite &ldquo;charge&rdquo; attributes (which produce the so-called
charge interactions). For this type of MS, there are repulsive
interactions (the formation of a new system is excluded) deployed
between the systems which release the same flux type (they have the
same charge), this formation being possible only between the systems
which release fluxes with opposite attributes (with attractive
interactions). The attractive interaction is based even on the fact
that the element which releases (offer) a flux, let us say, a
positive one, needs to be supplied (demand) by a negative flux. There
are also two examples in this case, an abiotic and a biotic one.
<I>Example 1</I> <I>- </I>A classic case of a system made-up from MS
with opposite-charge fluxes is the hydrogen atom, which is neuter as
regards the electric flux (charge zero) for the outer systems. This
fact means that the proton&rsquo;s electric flux (positive) and the
electron&rsquo;s electric flux (negative) are <U>entirely</U>
recirculated between the two elements, this recirculation process
taking place in a volume with a spatial size grade of few Van der
Waals rays of H<SUB>2</SUB> molecule. <I>Example 2 </I>- Another case
of charge interactions is the one produced between the sexual
bio-systems (obviously from the same species). In this case, we are
also dealing with two elements types (male and female) which provide
fluxes with opposite attributes against their flux demand. However,
the structure of these fluxes is much more complex than the abiotic
MS structure, most of them being information fluxes, therefore, the
interactions deployed between the elements are mostly informational
ones. The female element needs masculine hormones, spermatozoids, and
protection against the external aggressions, both for her and mostly,
for her offsprings, by providing, in exchange, successors and some
services to the male. In this case, the charge attributes are (in
most of the circumstances) quasi-null for the outside of the system
(family), therefore, a full inner recirculation of the charge fluxes
takes place.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.8.3: The difference between the system&rsquo;s global flux demand
and the sum of the individual flux demand of its elements which will
build-up the system, but prior the system formation, it is
represented by the inner recirculated fluxes, fluxes which are
exchanged between the elements on mutual basis and which remain
stored inside the system until the moment of its destruction. A
particular aspect of this law was already presented in the comment
made on Law II, that is the case of the hydrogen atom, at which the
outer electric flux demand is null, even because of the total inner
recirculation of these fluxes between the two constitutive
complementary EP.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.8.4: One of the most simple examples for illustrating this law is
the photo-electric effect which consists in the emission of a
peripheral electron of an atom as a result of the impact between that
electron and a photon with a higher energy than the electron&rsquo;s
bonding energy (that is the system&rsquo;s partly dissociation). The
same result (dissociation) also occurs at the family systems or at
other forms of inter-human association at the moment when a more
favorable offer appears, which is able to surpass the constraints
(that is the equivalent of the bonding energy) generated by the old
agreement. Another visible consequence of this law is the increasing
tendency of the number of solitary individuals into the communities
with a high standard of living, due to the fact that the outer flux
offer (with its value equivalent-income) exceeds the current needs of
those individuals, and even provides sufficient resources for
growing-up their children as solitary individuals (not engaged in a
family bond).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.8.5: The underlining from the above adjuvant text (written with
normal fonts) within The Law 5 is meant to emphasize that where an
interaction takes place (on the set of all the elements belonging to
a CS and on the set of the neighbouring elements in case of a DS),
those particular interactions always occur between two elements. As
for the contributions brought by the two participants, in case of the
abiotic MS and in case of the energy fluxes, they are equal and with
opposite-directions (action and reaction), or otherwise speaking, the
export flux of an element towards its partner is equal to the import
flux coming from the related partner. In this case, we may say that
the interaction is equitable, that is a situation which may be
unconditionally applied to the entire generation of abiotic MS.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

7.8.6: By analyzing the general MS model and as we are about to see
in the following chapter, we have noticed that the materiality of a
system is proved (certified) by the presence of a RBS which has the
property of deflecting (to reflect) fluxes and by the presence of the
emergent fluxes from this RBS. When we have talked about RBS of a
specific MS, we have seen that this object (RBS) is made-up from RBS
fractions which belong to the elements of that particular MS, and its
emergent fluxes are also made-up from the emergent and
non-recirculated fluxes between MS elements. In other words, if the
MS&rsquo;s elements would not have their own RBS, the existence of a
global RBS of MS would not be possible either, and if the same
elements would not have emergent fluxes, neither the global emergent
fluxes of MS would be able to exist.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
