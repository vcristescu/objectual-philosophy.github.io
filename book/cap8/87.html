<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">8.7 Information
support systems</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As we have seen in
the definition 8.3.5 and in the axiom IV, the information, as an
invariant collection of properties of the surrounding objects which
are owned (stored) by an IPS, cannot exist without some support
material objects (so as no distribution can exist in the absence of
its abstract support). During this stage of the information support
analysis, we must admit that any material system is an <U>information
support</U> (for an IPS able to receive it), but it is a support for
its natural information: structure (form), external position, mass,
types of released fluxes etc. However, if it is necessary that the
support system to contain (to include, store) a <U>certain
information</U>, this MS cannot be made-up only by the rules of the
natural formation of the abiotic material systems (with a strictly
energetic formation criteria), but by also additional rules which are
added to the fundamental laws of natural abiotic MS (similar to the
case of artificial MS).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">In the previous
sections, we have seen that for achieving the perception of an
object&rsquo;s property by an IPS, that particular property must be
transmissible, which means that it must have a temporary support
along a specific open, material flux, efferent to the source object,
and this flux type must be included into the IPS&rsquo;s perception
range. In case of an IPS which detects that property, the efferent
flux from the object represents the material support of the perceived
attribute, that is ISS, along the path between object and RBS of IPS.
At the impact of the flux with the section of IPS specialized in
capturing this flux type (input unit), a conversion <I>external flux
- internal flux of inner ISS </I>deployed on a fraction from the
incident flux is about to take place.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">We must settle
right from the start that ISS can have various forms. Based on their
location against RBS of IPS, considered as a reference, we might
have:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Internal</I> ISS, which may
	exist and circulate as fluxes only inside RBS of IPS;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>External </I>ISS<I>, </I>which
	may be found outside IPS<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>6</SUP></A>5,
	their associated information being accessible to IPS only through
	its input units.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
processual class of objects (defined in paragr.4.3) which makes-up
the information&rsquo;s material support, there are the following
types, which are given below:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ISS belonging to class S<SUB>0</SUB>,
	with a spatial structure and a defined and invariant structure
	(characteristic mostly for the ISS of the information stored into
	IPS memory, but also for external storage ISS);</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ISS belonging to classes S<SUB>k</SUB>,
	which are processual objects with defined and invariant spatial
	velocity (in case of a certain type of propagation/displacement
	medium), characteristic for the information fluxes (both external
	and internal ones).</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">An ISS belonging to
the class S<SUB>0</SUB> is a specialized material system, initially
made-up in the phase of ISS <I>without associated information</I>
(erased, unrecorded, unwritten), from an <U>even</U> and invariant
spatial distribution of MS which release or reflect a certain type of
flux, this flux being accessible either to the information processing
unit or to a certain perception system (input unit) belonging to an
IPS (in case of the external ISS). According to the version with
<I>associated information</I> (written, recorded), the distribution
of the efferent fluxes is uneven (there are contrast elements), the
written information consisting even in the structure (spatial
distribution) of these irregularities. As any other realizable
distribution, there must be some elements of this distribution
(elementary ISS). The basic element of an ISS is an object with a
null internal differential information (contrast), for example a
pixel. This means we are dealing with an even inner distribution of a
transmissible attribute. The main condition, as we are about to see
later on, which is required to this structure of recorded ISS is that
it must be <U>invariant</U> during the entire period of information
storage (due to this reason, the information&rsquo;s support material
systems stored into the memory must belong to the class S<SUB>0</SUB>).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">A specific
structure of the contrast elements within a specific ISS is perceived
by IPS as a distinct <U>object</U> (with all the object&rsquo;s
attributes - internal range, distributed attribute, distribution
type, internal reference and moment of existence). This structure
information of ISS is related to the external information which has
generated the formation of that particular structure into the input
unit of IPS.</P>

<B>semantic information</B> (synonym - <B>semantic value</B>) of that
structure.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">This external
information consists of the total amount of the attributes of the
external fluxes perceived by the input units of IPS from the source
object. Because each external perceptible property is related to a
distinct property of an internal ISS (made by the sensory organ
specialized in receiving that property), this means that the
properties of these ISS (with a simultaneous existence for the same
external object which is perceived) are an <I>internal representation</I>
(a conformable representation) of the external object.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: #f2f2f2; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.01in 0.06in"><A NAME="representation"></A>

8.7.2:</B> The internal ISS, associated to a specific external
semantic value is the <B>representation</B> of that semantic value
into the internal medium of IPS.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The information
processing systems are also S-type MS, which means that they have a
RBS and an internal invariant structure. The integrity of this system
is based on the fact that RBS allow the inner access only to the
fluxes which are necessary in order to maintain their functions. If
the external systems have a restricted access inside IPS, it might
however exist some internal <U>representations</U> of these systems,
mostly of the &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; ones (in case of the
bio-systems), namely of those which present a potential danger or are
useful (such as food, for instance) for the host systems.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Otherwise speaking,
the total amount of the internal representations (of the internal ISS
with associated external information) is a global representation of
the external reality for a specific IPS. Each state of the material
systems found outside IPS and <U>perceived by this system</U> shall
be related to a specific state (structure, configuration) of the
internal corresponding ISS.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: #f2f2f2; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.01in 0.06in"><A NAME="synt_value"></A>

8.7.3:</B> The information contained into the <U>structure attributes</U>
of an ISS is named <B>syntactic information</B> (synonym - <B>syntactic
value</B>) of this structure.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">For example, an 8
bits binary word has 256 different syntactic values, values which
correspond to the same number of combination possibilities (spatial
structure) of two symbols (0 and 1), arranged in groups of eight.
According to a convention, this kind of syntactic value is related to
a semantic value: a digital value, an alphanumeric character, a
color, an operation type performed by the processor etc. Another
example could be taken from the text-editors field in which a certain
character from the alphabet owns lots of syntactic versions, such as
font, <FONT SIZE=2>size, </FONT><B>bold</B>, <I>italics</I>,
<U>underline</U>, <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">color</FONT> etc. but the
semantic value is unchanged and it is related to the same character.
For understanding the definition 8.7.3, it is important that IPS to
be able to accurately distinguish each of these structures, in other
words, to separate two different syntactic values, because only in
this way the separation of their associated semantic values would be
possible.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The internal
configuration of an ISS is not random, being the result of the
application of some composition rules of the elements belonging to
these specialized MS.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: #f2f2f2; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.01in 0.06in"><A NAME="syntax"></A>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">If we take into
consideration the same example from ISS domain used within AIPS, the
8 bits word is structured according to very precise rules:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The word is an ordered series of
	reserved, disjoint but adjacent, spatial domains (abstract
	containers, see annex X.4), series in which any domain is related to

<UL>

</UL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">After all the
aspects which were presented so far, the result is that there is a
dependence relation between the syntactic information of an ISS and
its semantic information, in other words, there is a set of
assignment relations between the set of the possible structures of an
ISS class and the set of its associated semantic values. However,
according to the terminology of the objectual philosophy, we have
seen (in chapter 2) that this kind of set of assignment relations is
named <I>distribution</I>.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
8.7.1:<B> </B>Despite its simplicity, the definition 8.7.5 is
applicable for any kind of language and it even suggests the
existence of more language levels, due to the simple fact that each
ISS class would be associated with a certain language type. According
to the brief classifications of the ISS classes which were previously
made, we are finding that two major language categories must exist -
the <I>internal and external</I> ones - corresponding to the
aforementioned internal and external ISS classes. In case of ISS
which are placed outside the human body, for example for the
visual-literal ISS of the natural written language, an external
language would be associated (it is normal because the natural
language is used for the external information communication fluxes).
In case of this language, the distribution of the semantic values on
the set of syntactic values is not provided by an invariant relation
(as it is in case of the functions), but by a very large number of
individual relations which you may find, for instance, in the
explanatory dictionary of that particular language, and by a set of
modification rules of these semantic values depending on the
modifications allowed to be made on ISS structure (grammar rules).
First, it is started with a steady and quite reduced number of
elementary ISS, with a distinct syntactic value (characters of the
written language: letters, digits and punctuation marks etc.) for
which there is a single assignment relation between the semantic and
syntactic value, assignment which does not depend on context. The
association (composition) of these elements into compound objects
with a strict order but a variable length (words), then, of the words
into more complex structures (collocations, clauses, compound
sentences, etc.) shall lead to numerous possible syntactic values
which would be related to the semantic values by means of relations
which are specific to each language. We may also consider as external
languages (in the human society) the natural spoken language, body
language, behavior language etc., each syntactic value (phoneme
series, set of movements made by specific body parts or by the face
muscles) being related to defined and invariant semantic values
specific for a particular social group or specific to a certain
population. More surprisingly (and probably a controversy generator)
is the idea of a mandatory existence of some <I>internal languages</I>
which represent the distribution of semantic values (information
external to IPS) on the set of syntactic values of the internal ISS.
If this is an unquestionable fact in case of AIPS, the internal
language being achieved by the designers of the processor and of the
other programmable sub-units, as regards the biotic IPS, the
existence of this language (possibly unified on the level of an
entire reign, but with a &ldquo;vocabulary&rdquo; which depends on
the species&rsquo; evolution degree) is a very significant
consequence of the implementation of the IPS generic model.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the language, mostly regarding
the natural language and the association of semantic values to some
syntactic values within this language, this topic shall be also
depicted in the following chapter as well as in the annexes.
Momentarily, we are only interested in finding how and who makes the
association of semantic values within the internal ISS classes.</P>

	The dependence relation between the qualitative value (position
	within a structure) and the quantitative value of the element which
	is placed on that position is very obvious at the social structures.
	For example, within a political structure (a government, for
	instance), there are defined positions which have a finite number
	being strictly arranged into a certain hierarchical order. These
	positions may be vacant or not. If they are not vacant, the element
	which is placed on a certain position shall also receive the
	corresponding quantitative attributes (salary, power of decision
