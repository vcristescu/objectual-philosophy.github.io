<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Unlike the abiotic material systems, which show a passive behavior at
the variations of the environmental conditions, there is also a class
of MS - bio-systems - which reacts actively, sometimes, even with
anticipation, by modifying its internal and external state depending
on the environment conditions, so that the effect of the external
variations on the inside to be as low as possible.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The bio-systems existence, as well as of any other MS, is not
possible under any environment conditions, but only <U>under
favorable conditions</U>. The term of <I>favorable conditions</I>
must be momentarily understood as an union of admitted intervals for
the attributes of the external medium which are able to allow the
existence of an already developed bio-system (we are not talking
about the environmental conditions which have led to the bio-systems
occurrence). These conditions refer to the environment&rsquo;s
physical-chemical parameters, such as the pressure, temperature,
chemical reactivity (pH), concentration of useful and/or harmful
substances, or to its biological parameters, such as the presence of
other bio-systems in the proximity, bio-systems which can be either a
source of food or danger. For being able to survive (to avoid the
unfavorable conditions which might shorten their life, which is
limited anyway) and to exert their characteristic functions, the
bio-systems are able to unfold specific processes, which are not
found at the abiotic systems.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Such a process is the <I>information acquisition and processing</I>,
process which alongside other processes (feeding, excretion,
reproduction etc.) make-up the group of the fundamental processes
(model-like) of the bio-systems classes (described in the annex
X.11). This process is achieved by a specific part of the bio-system,
called <I>information processing system</I> (IPS). The information
processing system was possible due to the occurrence of an internal
specialized class of systems (material as well), whose structure
(configuration) is direct and univocally dependent on the external
environmental conditions, more exactly, on the distribution of the
external fluxes density on the bio-system&rsquo;s RBS. The state of
these systems which are specialized in the storage and transport of
the information perceivable by certain components of IPS is named
<I>internal information</I>, and those systems are named internal
<I>information support systems </I>(ISS).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The environment conditions are very important in order to achieve the
functions which are specific to the bio-systems, as it was previously
mentioned. The bio-systems must avoid as much as possible the
unfavorable conditions and to initiate the feeding and reproduction
processes if these are favorable conditions. For achieving this goal,
the bio-systems have the capacity to make the difference between a
<I>present</I> state of the environment and a <I>previous</I> state
of the same environment. It is clear that the comparison operation of
two different environment conditions, assessed in two different
moments, may be reduced to the internal comparison of the structure
(configuration, state) of the two internal systems which carry the
information received in those particular moments. As a result of this
operation (information comparison), another ISS arises, whose state
represents the difference between the two compared information. The
information contained in this latter ISS, together with the reference
information stockpile, shall determine the reaction, the modification
of the internal and external state of the bio-system against the new
environment state. Similarly with the abiotic systems, where the
modification of the internal state as a result of the penetration of
a flux <I>Y</I> shall be referred to as the <I>action of the flux Y</I>
on the system, we may also call the bio-system&rsquo;s reaction to
the new environmental conditions as the <I>action of the information
flux</I> on the bio-system. Do not confound the information action
(produced by the stimulus), with the physical action, produced by the
external energy fluxes on the bio-system&rsquo;s abiotic support. As
I have mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, this external
modification of the bio-system&rsquo;s state as a result of the
action of an information flux is known under the more generic term of
<I>behavior.</I> This obviously means the &ldquo;visible&rdquo;
(external) state modifications from the outside, observed by another
bio-system; the internal state modifications which occur before the
external ones, are not perceptible from the outside, because they are
found in the extremely complex domain of the bio-system&rsquo;s
internal fluxes.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Based on the knowledge gathered by the mankind so far, we know that
the bio-systems<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>6</SUP></A>1
comprise two IPS types:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Structural
	synthesis IPS, that is a system which processes the genetic
	information whose main ISS is the huge DNA molecule which guides the
	synthesis processes of a new bio-system, or the structural and
	functional maintenance processes of an existing one. This system
	(synthesis IPS) is distributed at the level and inside each
	constitutive cell of the bio-system, but there is a general
	correlation between these cells through the fluxes which recirculate
	between the proximity cells or through the blood and lymphatic
	communication system.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Relational
	IPS, which guides the bio-system&rsquo;s behavior and its
	physiological functions depending on the environment conditions,
	system which, as I have already mentioned, consists of an amount of
	specialized cells (neurons) which make-up the nervous system of the
	superior bio-systems.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
For the purpose of the present section, we are only interested in the
relational IPS (more exactly, the one which maintains external
relations outside the bio-system) because it is responsible for the
perception of the fluxes deployed in the external medium of the
bio-system&rsquo;s real bounding surface. As for this type of natural
IPS and for an advanced class of bio-systems (with neuronal IPS), its
basic components are given below:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><I>Sensory
	organs</I>, which are responsible for the receiving of the external
	fluxes, differentiated according to the flux type, therefore by
	types of transmissible attributes;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The <I>ensemble
	of neurons</I> which make-up the information processing units coming
	from the sensory organs;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The <I>ensemble
	of nerve endings</I> which controls the effector organs (muscular
	system and the organs with internal and external secretion);</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The <I>ensemble
	of nerve fibres</I> (nerves) which makes the connection between the
	sensory organs, neurons and the effector organs, ensemble which
	represents the <I>internal communication system</I> (of IPS);</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Besides all these well-known components which may be found in the
current scientific references, we may add the internal IPS medium
made-up from the set of internal ISS, which are systems considered as
the objects of the internal information fluxes (even intracellular
ones), which store the information and which run through the internal
communication system.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
As any other MS, the natural IPS (the neuronal one) has a RBS which
separates <U>inside the bio-system</U> the parts which are involved
in the structure of the above-mentioned IPS from the rest of the
bio-system&rsquo;s components. Otherwise speaking, the internal ISS
fluxes are forced to remain (are closed) inside this RBS. The only
access &ldquo;gates&rdquo; for the input or output fluxes are the
sensory organs (for the input fluxes) and the nerve endings (for the
output fluxes). The external sensory organs have a section of their
bounding surface which is common to the bio-system&rsquo;s RBS,
making-up a specialized RBS section which has an outstanding property
- its permeability is different from zero only in case of a specific
flux type, and the value of this permeability may be controlled by
IPS. For example, the tactile sensors are sensitive at kinetic
stochastic fluxes (pressure), the thermal ones are sensitive to
thermal photon fluxes, the visual ones are sensitive to photon fluxes
from the visible domain, the gustatory, olfactory and pheromonic ones
are sensitive to molecular fluxes, and the acoustic sensors are
sensitive to sound fluxes (pressure waves) etc.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The flux type to which the specialized RBS is permeable defines the
property of external MS to which that particular organ is sensitive
to. Inside the sensory organ, the conversion of the intensity and
spatial distribution of the immergent flux through RBS takes place on
the structure of the internal ISS, that is a conversion which is
repeated at certain regular time intervals. This process occurs
simultaneously for all the elementary information channels which are
found within the biotic IPS (all the sensory cells belonging to all
the sensory organs from the bio-system&rsquo;s &ldquo;endowment&rdquo;).
Inside IPS, a specific structure of ISS, generated at a certain
moment by a specific sensory organ, is perceived by the bio-system as
a certain sensation felt by the specialized domain of that particular
organ.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The total amount of the inner information stored on ISS provided by
the sensory organs is processed afterwards into specialized units -
neurons - a parallel and synchronic processing within the set of the
neurons which make-up the central nervous system. This processing
operation is also focused on the set of internal ISS, any operation
performed on the information contained inside them representing an
intervention on the structure (configuration) of these ISS. One of
the most frequent processes of information processing which was
previously mentioned is represented by the comparison between the ISS
structure associated to the current state of the external medium
(barely provided by the sensory system) and the ISS structure
associated to a previous state of the same medium, which is also
provided by the sensory system and <U>memorized</U> (stored) within a
spatial position adjacent into the ISS neuron input medium. The
result of this comparison, which is materialized on an ISS as well,
but on an ISS with another structure, shall represent the final
information (difference between the medium&rsquo;s states),
information which will determine (as a result of other processing
operations) the reaction, bio-system&rsquo;s behavior modification,
through the output ISS flux sent to the nerve endings which control
the effector organs. We do not insist on the information processing
operations, because we are only interested in the composition,
structure elements of biotic IPS, by making a special remark: any
information processing operation takes place on the internal ISS
structure when some of them remain non-altered (as much as possible)
during the entire bio-system&rsquo;s lifetime (by making-up its
so-called &ldquo;life experience&rdquo;, the informational
reference), and the others shall be used within temporary processing
operations by considering that reference as a comparison standard.</P>
