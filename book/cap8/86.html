<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">8.6 General IPS
model</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">After this
extremely brief presentation of the generic structure of two IPS
types, the natural neuronal<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>6</SUP></A>3
and the artificial ones, no matter how bizarre would seem to be, we
must notice that there are common elements between these realizable
IPS classes which can form a general model of these MS types.
However, a very significant specification is needed at the beginning:
both the natural and artificial IPS are a subclass of the material
systems, therefore, they are systems with the materiality acquired
from the support abiotic systems, with all the specific attributes of
the abiotic MS, at which the specific attributes of IPS is added.
From the complexity point of view (structural level), IPS are however
extremely complex systems as compared to the systems which make-up
their generating set - the abiotic systems.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the
structural descriptions of the two above-mentioned IPS types, we may
now draw out the common components of the two system types:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Existence of a RBS (just like for
	any MS) which defines (separates) the <I>internal </I>and the
	<I>external</I> side of the system.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are <I>specialized transfer
	zones</I> on this RBS which have a defined area and an invariant
	location against the internal spatial reference, through which
	controlled flux transfers can be made. <I>Specialized zone</I> means
	a RBS portion whose permeability (transmittance) is <U>selective at
	a specific flux type</U> and this permeability can be controlled <U>
	inside the IPS</U>. These zones belong to the <I>input/output units</I>
	of IPS.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside IPS, there is a special
	class of MS, namely the internal<I> information support systems
	</I>(ISS), systems whose properties may be detected by IPS, strictly
	depending on the properties of the fluxes received by the input
	units.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Also inside IPS, there is a
	sub-system known as the <I>information processing unit</I> which has
	the following specific features:</P>
</OL>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Capacity to detect (perceive,
	determine) the specific property of an internal ISS (property which
	is <U>the representation</U> of a property perceived from an
	external IPS object) and to distinguish between two different values
	of this property.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Capacity to modify this property
	according to specific rules, by also modifying the information
	contained into ISS.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Capacity to perceive a temporal
	succession (distribution) of the values associated to two input ISS,
	otherwise speaking, to make a difference between a <I>previous </I>and
	a <I>present</I> value.</P>
</OL>
<OL START=5>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another essential sub-system of
	IPS is the <I>storage unit</I> of ISS (IPS memory), to which the
	processing unit has access to. This unit stores the entire
	information amount received during the functional operation of IPS.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ISS circulation (fluxes) is
	required between all the IPS&rsquo;s internal sub-systems,
	therefore, some <I>communication ways</I> for guiding these internal
	fluxes must exist. For avoiding the losses along the route, these
	fluxes must have a constant effective section (isotom fluxes).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maintenance of the internal
	ISS fluxes and of the functional fluxes belonging to IPS components,
	which is a <I>sine qua non</I> condition for its operation,
	determines the need for an additional energy supply over the normal
	energy demand of the abiotic support from which the IPS sub-systems
	are made of. This additional energy is obtained from the second
	level supply fluxes (the first level is for the supply of abiotic
	MS), and these are fluxes provided by the host material system (in
	case of the bio-systems) or by special supply systems (in case of
	AIPS).</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
above-mentioned issues, the general model of IPS which is proposed by
the objectual philosophy, valid both for the natural and artificial
IPS, is made-up from the following material sub-systems:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I><B>Input units</B></I>, which
	convert the incident external fluxes from the specialized zones of
	RBS into corresponding internal ISS fluxes;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I><B>Output units</B></I>, which
	make the reverse conversion, from the internal ISS fluxes into
	emergent and transmissible fluxes outside IPS;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I><B>Internal communication
	system, </B></I>which provides the canalization of the internal ISS
	fluxes;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I><B>Information processing
	units</B></I>, able to perceive the internal ISS structure and to
	operate with this structure according to the information processing
	rules specific to a certain IPS;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I><B>The organized set of the
	internal ISS</B></I>, the generating set of information carrier
	ISS<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>,
	organized as an invariant object named <I><B>memory</B></I>;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second level energy<I><B>
	supply units</B></I>.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The understanding
of this IPS general model cannot be clearly achieved without to
explain what are the information support systems, this MS class
without whom the existence of any information processing operation
would not be possible.</P>

	The neuronal IPS are the most notorious natural information
	processing systems but we must take into account that these systems
	operate based on the fundamental information processing mechanisms
	inside the cell, which are insufficiently known so far. Due to these
	reasons, we did not include the description of the intracellular IPS
	into the above-mentioned presentation, but we shall start from the
	premises that the basic elements of the general structure of an IPS
	may be also found at this organization level.</P>
