principle of the material systems existence</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">We have noticed in
the chapter focused on the general model of MS that these systems are
characterized by a triad of the fluxes, made-up from input, output
fluxes, as well as fluxes stored inside RBS of MS. By considering
these three basic flux types, we have seen that the stored fluxes, as
well as the ones which are generated by the stored fluxes (output
fluxes) would not be able to exist without MS. On the other hand, the
stored fluxes are permanently kept inside RBS (they are confined into
this surface) so that they produce no effect (action) into the
external medium.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Unlike the stored
fluxes, the <I>efferent</I> fluxes (composed from the emergent fluxes
and the ones reflected by RBS) are open fluxes which may have an
impact on MS with whom it intersects to, fluxes which would not be
able to exist in the absence of the source MS. A special type of MS
which shall be <U>temporarily</U> referred to (only for the
beginning) as <I><B>receiver MS</B></I>, able to capture a part of
these fluxes and to establish the spatial position of their source,
will also be able to perform an extremely significant operation -
that is the <I>attestation </I>(validation, establishing) of the
<I>informational existence</I> (with its synonym - <I>subjective
existence</I>) of the sender MS placed on that position.</P>

8.3.1: We have seen in the introductory section of this chapter that
the natural abiotic MS are not able to distinguish the direction
where the incident fluxes are coming from, this kind of system always
moving towards the direction of the unique resultant of these fluxes.
Only this resultant is valid for such systems, whose direction does
not usually match to the direction of a real object. The term of
<I>informational existence</I> is in many ways similar to the
<I>subjective existence</I> from the traditional philosophy, but in
this context, it explicitly underlines the necessity of an IPS for
its attestation. The existence principle which is mentioned herein
may be disputed by the traditional philosophers who claim the
<I>objective existence</I> of a material object, regardless of our
knowledge degree. The objectual philosophy does not dispute this
possible existence either, but it considers it only as a virtual,
imaginary object, belonging to the absolute reality, which shall be
approached in chapter 9; however, the existence of a real object,
which is able to cause us a joy or a trouble, will be established
only after it has been experimentally validated (through the
perception of an efferent material flux belonging to the object) by
our IPS (the human nervous system), and under the possible estimation
limits of the lifespan of that particular object. When we shall be
dealing with the term <I>existence</I>, later on, in this paper, it
must be understood that it exclusively refers to the informational
(subjective) existence which is valid only for an IPS, or for a
system made-up from IPS.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">By
taking</FONT> into account the finding that the fluxes which are
efferent to a MS would not be able to exist without the prior
existence of the stored fluxes, therefore, of the entire MS, by
capturing a part from these efferent fluxes, the existence of a flux
source can be validated. It is also very important that this
validation to be done in <U>a remote location, far</U> from the
source system, because the concept of flux means (as we have seen in
chapter 5) the transport of an amount from a zone in space towards
another zone. We have also seen in the same chapter that there are
more flux types, therefore, the efferent fluxes from a MS must comply
with the same rules.</P>

8.3.2: The definition 8.3.1 must be carefully interpreted because it
may lead the reader to a wrong conclusions. For example, the photons
reflected by an object (for example, a building) make-up a flux which
carries to our visual organ more properties which belong to this
flux: color, intensity, direction etc. Many of these properties
belong not to the aimed object but to the effective photon source
(the light source where the photons are coming from), such as the
initial color (the frequency distribution of the incident flux) and
the luminous intensity. The direction of the photons which are
reflected by the object and the color of its surface are properties
which however belong exclusively to the aimed object. The selective
properties of the object&rsquo;s RBS determine that only specific
sections from the photon flux to be reflected, so that an additional
identification method of the properties of the reflecting object must
also exist, and these properties are thus becoming transmissible (but
indirect).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

8.3.3: The definition 8.3.2 refers to most of the properties which
are directly perceivable by the input units of IPS, such as the
bio-systems characterized by the intensity of a sound, flavor, taste,
radiated or reflected light, heat intensity etc., but there are also
transmissible qualitative properties such as the color, size or
position of an external object, whose existential attributes are not
determined directly, from the intensity of the received fluxes, but
by means of calculus, by processing the information contained into
the derived distributions of the primary sensory distributions (see
annex X.18). In case of these properties, it is not the flux
intensity which is the main issue (which must be only perceivable),
but the most relevant aspect is the positions of the intensity&rsquo;s
contrast elements (which shows the object&rsquo;s boundary) against
the inner reference of the sense organ.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The non-zero
intensity of an efferent flux from a source MS is considered for the
receiver MS as a &ldquo;confirmation&rdquo; of the existence of
source MS, and as we are about to see next, in case that this
intensity does not exceed a specific threshold (perception threshold
of the receiving MS), then the source system <U>does not exist</U>
for the receiver MS. This attribute (intensity of the efferent flux)
is therefore considered, in case of the receiver MS, as an estimation
method of the existence of that received property at the source MS,
as well as an estimation of the object which owns it (that is why it
is referred to as an existential attribute).</P>

8.3.4: As we have already underlined in the comment 8.3.3, besides
the direct attributes which are both quantitative and qualitative,
there are also indirect attributes, assessed by means of an
upper-rank information processing. If the primary attributes are
related to the properties owned by the primary distributions of the
fluxes emerging from objects, the indirect attributes (secondary,
derived) are determined by the properties of the derived
distributions (temporal, spatial or frequency) of the primary
distributions.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The inherent habit
of the people to associate properties to the directly perceived
objects (through the sense organs) is based on the fact that each
sensory organ is specialized (as I have previously mentioned) in
receiving a specific flux type.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
8.3.5: The more and more increased differentiation of the fluxes
attributes takes place inside each sensory organ, each flux being
either a space-temporal or a frequency-temporal distribution, the
sensory organ is requested to analyze the distribution type by means
of its decomposition into elements (with even distribution). For
example, the photon fluxes from the visible domain are decomposed
into frequency intervals which correspond to the basic shades (red,
green, blue or R, G, B), by the specialized receivers (cones) from
the retina, each interval with its existential attribute (flux
intensity from that particular domain). Three cones, R, G, B which
are spatially adjacent on the retina make-up a retina-sensitive
element (a pixel) which is able to receive an elementary photon flux.
In the fovea section, where the cones are mainly found, the effective
area of a pixel is an elementary area, which cuts-off the possibility
of revealing the spatial irregularities of the incident flux, this
area will therefore receive an elementary photon flux. The spatial
distribution of the elementary photon fluxes which are incident on
the retina is point to point conformal with the spatial distribution
of the flux point sources outside the eye (the appropriate
transformation is made by the crystalline lens), and thus, we are
dealing with a retina representation (an image) of a spatial
distribution of a property belonging to the external object (visually
speaking, its spatial configuration), alongside the properties of
each source point (color, reflection degree etc.). For us, the most
relevant aspect is to keep in mind that each property (quality) of an
observed object is due to a specific flux type for which we have
specialized sensors. We are about to see next that other qualitative
properties of the real objects are also due to specific
space-frequency-temporal distributions of the external fluxes which
we are able to perceive them, if not under direct sensorial means, at
least through some auxiliary means (such as the equipment used in the
scientific research), which are means able to convert some of the
fluxes which cannot be directly perceived into directly perceived
fluxes.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Besides the type of
the transported amount, the open fluxes have also specific properties
which are common to all the fluxes - amount (modulus) and FDV
direction. These last properties make a local characterization (in a
specific spatial point) of the flux efferent to a MS, but since they
are common to all the fluxes, they are also considered as a criterion
for the evaluation of a generic property of the flux sources.</P>

annex X.15) can be used for the determination of the spatial position
of the flux source (provided that FDV direction to be invariant on
the distance between source and receiver). In other words, these
local properties are also some transmissible attributes of a generic
property of all the flux sources - <I>spatial position</I> - of that
source against the spatial position of the receiver MS (the
reference).</P>

been probably observing that the definition 8.3.5 shows constitutive
elements of the generic definition for describing the <I>object</I>
notion (presented in chapter 3). So it is, because the object is
nothing else but a generic denomination for a finite and
distinguishable amount of qualitative and quantitative information.
Based on the same definition, there is an inseparable bond relation
between the information notion and MS concept to whom that
information belongs to. Consequently, the objectual philosophy makes
the following assertion:</P>

the axiom IV could be better understood by the reader later on, when
the generic IPS model shall be presented, and moreover, after we
shall analyze the basic functions of this kind of MS. For the time
being, in order to draw up a general model, there are few particular
types of information processing systems which need to be briefly
