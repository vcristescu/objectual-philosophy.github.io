<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">8.2 Real
objects and their properties</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">If we are analyzing
the properties of the surrounding real objects, we shall observe that
these properties are found in a finite number, moreover, some of
their properties are common to a group of different objects. We might
say that the set of the attributes (properties) of the real objects
is finite inside a specific language (for instance, the natural
language). This finite set of attributes may be found inside that
particular language under the form of a finite set of words - the
lexical fund which defines the objects&rsquo; attributes. We may also
notice that, according to our sense organs, the objects&rsquo;
properties may be divided into the following groups:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Visual properties</I>: shape,
	color, spatial position (against the eye&rsquo;s inner reference,
	against the inner reference of the human body and against the inner
	reference of the aimed object), motion velocity, surface state
	(gloss, texture etc.) etc.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Tactile properties</I>:
	hardness, surface roughness, spatial position of the area with
	pressure contrast against the inner reference of the body&rsquo;s
	position etc.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Auditory properties: </I>noise
	produced by an object or by the motion of hand or of other object
	across its surface, noise produced by the bursting or breaking of
	the object, direction (spatial position) of the noise source etc.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Thermal properties:</I> warm,
	cold (as compared to the skin temperature, that is the thermal
	sensors zone), spatial position of the area with a temperature
	contrast as compared to the inner reference of the body&rsquo;s
	position etc.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Kinesthetic (proprioceptive)
	properties</I>: shape, weight, spatial size grade, relative position
	against the body&rsquo;s inner reference etc, which are properties
	given by the spatial distribution of the constriction and straining
	degree of the muscles &ldquo;from the endowment&rdquo; of the
	bio-system.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Gustatory and olfactory
	properties, </I>stereo-chemical structure attributes of some
	molecular fluxes with liquid and gaseous support which are generated
	by the object etc.</P>
</UL>

8.2.1:<I> </I>Besides the above-mentioned properties, which may be
referred to as <I>direct </I>sensory properties, there is also a
non-specified number of indirect properties, which are obtained by
means of the artificial flux converters, extension means of the
perception thresholds beyond their natural domains (photon domain IR,
UV, X, 
<IMG SRC="82_html_m62a5594a.gif" NAME="Object434" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=17>,
or of the temperature which is lower or higher than the domain of the
thermal receivers, infra or ultra acoustic domain, electric or
magnetic properties etc.). The aspect which must be underlined is
that any indirect property is converted into a direct property
(sensorial), the only access way to the inner IPS specialized in
relations with the outside (the somatic nervous system). There is
another extended class of processual (behavioristic) properties which
may be applicable both to the abiotic MS, but mostly to the
bio-systems, which differentiate the systems based on the way in
which they behave during some specific processes. For example,
properties such as flexibility, malleability, ductility etc. refer to
the way how that particular material behaves during some specific
processes: bending, deformation, drawing etc. As for the humans,
these behavioristic attributes are more numerous than the direct
attributes, denoting character types (choleric, sanguines, phlegmatic
etc.), psychic moods (cheerful, sad, cool, excited etc.), and many
more. However, all these behavioristic attributes are complex
objects, made-up from successions (temporal distributions) of direct
properties which are monitored on long periods of time during the
body&rsquo;s lifetime. Some sense organs have been voluntarily
omitted, either due to their limited role into the human perception
(such as the vomeronasal organ), or due to the fact that they have no
connection with the perception of the outer fluxes (such as the
vestibular system or the perception system of the body&rsquo;s inner
states).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Now, let us analyze
each of these properties groups in order to notice what are their
causes (which is the material support of the properties). Based on
the current knowledge level, we know that the visual and thermal
properties are provided by means of the photon fluxes emitted or
reflected by the perceived object; if the photons have wavelengths
included in the visible domain (400&hellip;800 nm), they will be
perceived by the sight sensors (as a visual sensation), whereas, if
they have wavelengths reaching the infrared domain (900 nm&hellip;.1
mm), they will be perceived by the thermal sensors (as a thermal
sensation).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The auditory
properties of an object are provided to us by means of the pressure
waves generated into the medium (air, water etc.) which separates us
from the object, by the processes which take place into the emitter
object. These waves are propagated through that medium (therefore, we
are dealing with a propagation flux as well), a part from this flux
being captured by our sense organ. In this case, it means also a
perceptible frequency domain (20&hellip;20000 Hz).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The tactile and
kinesthetic properties are also provided to us through fluxes, but
this time we are dealing with stochastic (pressure) fluxes. The
tactile sensors perceive the pressure produced at the direct contact
between skin (sensors&rsquo; area) and RBS of the perceived object,
whereas the kinesthetic sensors also perceive a pressure (stretching,
straining) of the muscular fibre.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The
gustatory/olfactory properties are transmitted by means of molecular
fluxes coming from the perceived object and they are either airborne,
in case of the olfactory sensors, or carried by a liquid medium
(water-based solutions, suspensions or emulsions), in case of the
gustatory sensors.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The following
conclusions may be drawn based on the above-mentioned issues:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any real object is identifiable
	(recognizable) only by means of the reunion of its properties
	perceived by our sense organs and stored in our memory, properties
	which are distributed on the object&rsquo;s finite spatial domain.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The object&rsquo;s properties
	(attributes) reach to us through specific fluxes which are efferent
	to the object (from the object towards our sense organs) - photon
	fluxes for the visual and thermal sensors, molecular fluxes for the
	gustatory and olfactory sensors, stochastic (pressure) fluxes for
	the tactile and acoustic sensors, etc.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fluxes perceived by our sense
	organs are either produced by the object (emergent from its inner
	section) or inflected (reflected) by it, therefore, these fluxes
	<U>would not be able to exist in the absence of the source object</U>.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The presence of an efferent flux
	from an object, whose intensity exceeds the detection threshold of
	the specific sense organ, may be considered for the perception
	system as an information which certifies the object&rsquo;s
	<I>existence</I> (at the moment of perception).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The above-mentioned sensorial
	properties are basic (elementary) properties of the objects from the
	real (material) world, therefore, these properties and their
	associated processes make-up the basis of all the upper level
	properties (more complex) of any real object.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each sense organ is specialized in
	the receiving (detection, perception) of a certain type of material
	flux (either it is coherent or stochastic, propagation or
	displacement type), therefore, each distinct property of a real
	object is due to a certain type of flux, to its intensity, spatial,
	temporal or frequency distribution on the spatial domain occupied by
	the object.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">We have seen
	that the variation (change, modification) throughout time of certain
	properties associated to an object is called a <I>specific process</I>.
	Because each elementary property is based on a certain flux type,
	each specific process of that particular property is based on a
	process through which the support flux undergoes, as well as the
	source object of that particular flux.</SPAN></P>
