processing</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The fact that there
is a strict dependence between the structure (syntactic value) of an
ISS and its semantic value, it means that any alteration
(modification, variation) of this structure shall lead to the
alteration of the contained semantic information. This alteration of
the structure of an ISS may be either natural (such as the
physical-chemical damage of the ancient writings, oblivion of some
details from our past life), or &ldquo;intentional&rdquo;, in case of
the operations carried out on the internal ISS by the information
processing unit. Now, let us briefly find out what are these
modifications of the ISS internal structure, according to the
notorious case of AIPS.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">For AIPS class,
these changes on the syntactic value of internal ISS, performed on an
ISS element (bit) or group of elements (word) are named <I>operations.</I>
An operation is a <I>process</I> (because we are dealing with a
property variation of an object) in which there are one or more
initial objects (the elements or the words which are not modified
yet), which shall be named <I>operands</I>, the modification rule of
the operands structure which shall be named <I>operator</I>, and the
element or the modified word, called <I>result </I>of the operation.
We notice that the alteration type of the syntactic value (operation
type) which is required to an operand type is given by the operator
type, therefore, each distinct operation would be related to a
specific operator, which is included in the instruction list of the
processor, provided by its manufacturer. The operations included in
this list are elementary operations<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>6</SUP></A>8
(non-decomposable, also known as <I>instructions</I>), which however
are able to form series, (sequences) no matter how long but yet
finite, known as <I>programs</I>, which are also made-up from
sequences with an invariant composition of operations, named
<I>algorithms</I>. Even if it is probably not necessary, however, due
to safety reasons, we are underlining once again: <U>the operands,
operators and the result are internal ISS of AIPS.</U></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The operand meant
to a certain operation and the operation&rsquo;s result are specified
(distinguished, separated) by the amount of the other internal ISS by
means of the internal spatial position (location) of them against the
internal reference system of IPS, also defined by construction (the
registers addresses, first address of the matrix structure memory
etc.). Therefore, the spatial position of a distinct ISS is an
internal qualitative attribute which can be distinguished by the
processor.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">If you remember
what I have mentioned in chapter 3 about the reference systems of the
compound objects, you have already observed the existence of a
hierarchy of these reference systems, which is also valid for the ISS
objects inside AIPS. There are elementary ISS (bits) with spatial
domains and defined positions within the word (against the word&rsquo;s
internal reference), and then, there is a spatial reference against
which the position (address) of the word in a certain block may be
assessed, followed by the block reference, all of them being assessed
against the main reference (internal reference of IPS). The
specification of a certain operand means, besides the operand&rsquo;s
syntactic value, also the specification of its spatial location
(address); in this case, we are dealing with a first example of
association between two properties of a single object, the address
becoming the second property (besides the syntactic value) of the
word.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The <I>association</I>
operation of this new property is therefore a simple joining
(generation of a new object by means of external composition, as we
have seen in chapter 3) of the two ISS<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym" SDFIXED><SUP>6</SUP></A>9-
the one which contains the syntactic value and the one which hosts
the address (a syntactic value as well) of that value into the
internal spatial domain of IPS. This new object made-up from the
permanent composition (association) of two ISS with simultaneous
existence shall be completely determined (distinguishable) in the
entire set of the internal ISS from IPS because its memory location
is an unique specific attribute.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">After we clarified
what is an operand, let us see what kind of operators may be found at
AIPS, by mentioning that we are making only a review of the most
common ones usual within some generations of processors, regardless
of their manufacturer:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Transfer operators (since we are
	talking about transfer, it is clear that we are dealing with a flux
	initiation) from one location to another (both specified), transfer 
	which can be either conditioned or not;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Replication (copy) operators;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Replacement (substitution)
	operators, with a particular case - erasure;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Logical (qualitative) operators;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arithmetical (quantitative)
	operators.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The transfer operators do not alter the
value of the operand but only the value of its location, likewise the
replication and logical operators. The replacement operators do not
alter the location.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Among the above-mentioned operators,
the most important ones (from the point of view of the objectual
philosophy) are the transfer and comparison ones, the latter being
included both in the category of logical and arithmetical operators.
The logical (qualitative) comparison implies the analysis of ISS
structure of the two operands and to distinguish the difference
between these structures, and the result can only have two values:
<I>equal</I> (in case of the identical structures) or <I>different</I>
(non-equal). The arithmetic (quantitative) comparison is applied to
the quantitative values of the two operands (a difference as well),
<U>out of which, one is considered as a reference</U>, and depending
on the sign and value of this difference, we shall have three
possible results: <I>less </I>(negative sign), <I>major</I> (positive
sign) or <I>equal</I> (the difference value is under the perception
threshold of IPS, regardless its sign, and considered to be zero,
namely, the non-existent difference).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this brief foray into the field
of the common information processing operations characteristic to
AIPS, let us see what we know about the operations carried out by
NIPS, mainly by the human one. If we consider the above-mentioned
list of AIPS operations as a reference, we may certainly assert that
in case of the neuronal IPS, there are appropriate ISS transfers
(fluxes), but, for the time being, we do not know precisely if they
are commanded (just like in AIPS case) or they have a natural
existence, as any other vital flux. The fact that our brain is able
to access at a certain moment a massive amount of information when
making an evocation, this may confirm us that it is also likely to
exist a commanded transfer. Another fact which is also certain is
that there is no explicit erasure operation within the neuronal IPS,
the cancellation of unnecessary information is inherently made, by
omitting to make a refresh (mostly in case of the short-term memory).
On this occasion, we have also defined an operation performed within
the neuronal NIPS - that is the refreshment - which, in case of AIPS,
is equivalent with the refresh made within the dynamic memories,
operation which is similar with the replication and replacement
achieved at the same location. In fact, the replication at NIPS is
extensively present, starting with DNA replication within the cell
division and continuing with the information replication from DNA
segments within the transcript of the genetic information into RNA
sequences.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the quantitative operations, we
may only say that they are absolutely necessary for the evaluation of
the intensity of the fluxes which are carriers of external
information, that the result of this evaluation must be proportional
to the input values, and that the generated amount must determine the
amplitude of the IPS response, and of the host bio-system to that
final information. For all of these, there must be support for at
least three operations: logarithmation, addition and subtraction. The
logarithmation (which was experimentally found in some input units)
is necessary for covering a very wide intensity range of the incident
fluxes, with a much more reduced range of syntactic values. The
addition and subtraction are required in order to achieve other
information processing operations, out of which, one is of the
greatest interest for us - that is the <I>comparison</I>. So as this
operation could not miss within AIPS, it does not miss either at NIPS
because <I><B>the comparison is a fundamental information processing
operation</B></I>, which may be found at any type of IPS.</P>

8.9.1: For those who know something about the automatic control
systems, it is well known that a mandatory operational block within
the universal model of these systems is the comparison block, which
is a block meant to compare the input information (command) with the
output information (reaction proportional to the adjusted amount),
the result (difference) being applied at the input of the regulator.
Since most of the elements belonging to the vegetative system
(neuronal as well) are extremely complex control systems, it is
self-understood that the comparison operation must be mandatorily
implemented into the neuronal IPS. The existence of two
neuro-mediators classes - exciters and inhibitors - is considered as
a proof for the existence of the two operations - addition and
subtraction - of the intensity of fluxes transmitted through the
synapses.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As we have seen in case of AIPS, where
we have analyse in detail the comparison operation, its essence
consists in the simultaneous existence of the two operands at the
moment when the operation is in progress, out of which, one is
considered as a <U>reference</U> and it is <U>previously stored</U>
into IPS memory. However, we have noticed in chapter 3 that a
reference must be an <U>invariant object during its entire existence

8.9.2: The fact that a memory is able to store non-alterable
information only with condition that the support of this information
(ISS) to be also non-alterable throughout time, has a major impact on
the analysis method of the cognition processes, stated by the
objectual philosophy. The first consequence of this axiom is that
only the objects may be stored into a memory (ISS with an invariant
structure after storage) but not processes as well. We are reminding
that an object is an invariant collection of invariant attributes,
distributed on a common, as well as on an invariant support. An
indirect method is being used for the processes storage, that is the
storage of a series of sample objects (which are invariant once they
were stored), which were sampled at successive time intervals and
which contain the value of the variable attribute existing at the
moment of sampling (objects which were minutely described in chapter
4 and which are called <I>states</I>). These samples are stored in
successive and adjacent spatial locations, so that a temporal
difference <I>&#8710;t</I> would be related to a difference of
spatial position (location) <I>&#8710;r</I>. Therefore, the processes
shall be stored into the short-term memory of an IPS as a system of
objects (a series of invariant successive-adjacent elements)<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym" SDFIXED><SUP>7</SUP></A>0.
Even the fact that people have selected the notion of <I>state</I>
for describing an evolution of the attributes of specific objects may
be explained by the fact that our brain is not able to operate
directly with processes. Another consequence of this axiom is that
any ISS, either it is internal or external to an IPS, and regardless
if IPS is artificial or natural (biotic), it must be a S-type MS
(from the point of view of the detectable attribute by IPS) <U>during
the period of the information storage</U>. Because any information
found inside IPS may be used sometimes as a reference from a
comparison operation, it results that <U>all</U> ISS which are
carriers of internal information (written, recorded) must be
invariant during the existence of that particular information. A last
but not least significant consequence is even the fact that
information (mostly quantitative determination) means <U>invariance</U>,
the greater is the invariance degree, the greater is the information
amount (accuracy) and vice-versa. If you, my dear reader, were
patient enough to read up to this section, you will better understand
the definition 8.3.5 which was used for describing the information
concept.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So far, we have used notions such as
<I>simultaneous, previous, present</I> etc. with the meaning known by
each of us from the school or from our own experience. These words
are common because each of them is related to specific values of a
special attribute - that is the <I>temporal attribute</I> (the time).</P>

8.9.3: The perception of the direct reality (which shall be
subsequently defined) by an IPS (for instance, a human one) is made
through the channels of sensorial information. The total amount of 
the external objects whose efferent fluxes are captured by the
sensory channels, in parallel and at the same time, are considered to
have a <U>simultaneous existence</U>. Therefore, the simultaneous
existence of the objects requires <U>an unique moment for all these
objects</U>, even if those particular objects have an infinite number
(absolute reality in case of an IPS with infinite performance). The
perception of a property variation of an object from the real world
(such as the spatial position) is made by comparing that property
which was perceived at a present moment with the property of the same
object perceived <U>and stored</U> at a previous moment. The
difference between the two values will be even the attribute change
characteristic to a motion process of the object. It is clear that,
in order to unfold all these operations, IPS must be equipped with an
unique clock and the information generated by this clock at a
specific moment to be associated with all ISS which represent
external objects with a simultaneous existence. Under the assumption
that there are more IPS which communicate one another and are able to
perceive more, but the same objects with a simultaneous existence,
the individual simultaneity of the existence of these objects becomes
a collective simultaneity. For the synchronization of the collective
perceptions felt by a group of individuals, an external unique clock
is required - that is the collective temporal reference. Nowadays,
the mankind has such an unique clock (which defines the universal
time) which synchronizes the external time of each member of the
community, used for the description of any kind of process, but it is
valid only for humans and for the artificial IPS created by them. The
other bio-systems which do not communicate with people keep their own
clock, and the abiotic systems simply do not care about the universal
time which some people think it is real. The alleged reality of the
time comes from the uncontrolled nouning of the properties of objects
or processes, through which the properties are separated by the
support material object, by granting them afterwards an independent
existence, as if these properties would be able to exist without the
support on which they are distributed. Obviously, there are a lot of
periodical processes deployed into the external material world, but
their counting (which provides the result of the quantitative value
of the temporal attribute) is an <U>information processing operation,</U>
which is non-accessible to the abiotic MS, as any form of
information.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The temporal
attribute indicated in the axiom VI is the virtual time (mathematic,
ideal), with support values taken from the set of the real numbers
{R}. The independence of this qualitative attribute is an abstract
independence (by convention, by definition etc.), under the meaning
settled when defining the <I>independent</I> attribute, therefore, it
is assumed that there is no process whose variations to be able to
determine variations of the time running rate. However, the
realizable time (as it was mentioned at the beginning of this
chapter), is a counting of a very stable, real periodical process,
the numerical value stored in this counter (increased by an unit at
each completion of the cyclic process) being considered as an
existential attribute of the time (of the present moment).</P>

8.9.4: The stability of the repetitive process counted in case of the
realizable time derives from its isolation degree; the better
confined are the variable fluxes which make-up the repetitive process
and consequently, non-influenced by the external processes, the more
constant will be the frequency of that particular process. Because
the total isolation cannot be achieved, because both the process
elements and the isolation elements belong to the same medium - PFM
(ether) - no absolute stability is possible either. Moreover, any
variation of the motion of this ensemble through PFM<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">

therefore, into the process frequency. In other words, the realizable

cannot end this short foray into the information processing field
without mentioning an operation considered by the objectual
philosophy as a constitutive part to all the biotic IPS (including
the intracellular level) because it comes from the general
information organization manner into the DNA molecule. In this paper,
that particular operation (which is not an elementary operation, as
for NIPS its constitutive elements are still unknown) is named

and consists in the extraction of the common and specific components
of the set of perceived objects. If an identical common component
already exists in the long-term memory, the information is only
refreshed and it is associated only with the new perceived values
(specific components). If the specific components also exist, they
will be refreshed as well. If there are no more common components,
both classes of components belonging to the perceived objects shall
be stored. In this way, an information hierarchy occurs into the
biotic IPS memory, in which all the perceptions are organized on
classes of objects, with their common components stored one time, and
with the specific components which are individually stored. This is
an organization technique known by the IT experts as a method of
information compression, which is required for a more efficient
utilization of a finite resource - IPS memory.</FONT></P>

	This process of successive storage of some series of objects with
	variable attributes (successive as well) is mainly specific to the
	short-term memory (STM) in case of the biotic IPS, until the
	short-term prediction on the evolution of the on-going processes and
	the systemic review of the recently acquired information would take
	place. This kind of process may be also found at AIPS which are
	designed for the processing of the continuous signals received from
	the outside, where the sampling and memorization is the only storage
	method of these variable signals.</P>
