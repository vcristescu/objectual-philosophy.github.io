<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">8.8 Association
of semantic values to the syntactic values of the internal ISS</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the previous sections, we have seen
that the information concept is strictly related to the existence of
support MS, and that it represents the total amount of invariant
properties of those systems, perceived by another type of specialized
MS - information processing system - system whose general model was
previously presented. If the picture is not clear by now, we are
making an explicit underlining: <U>the information</U> (according to
the objectual philosophy) <U>exists only for the class of IPS
material systems</U>, the only systems which are able to operate with
this notion.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As we have shown earlier in this
chapter, in case of natural abiotic MS, the information and all the
features which derive from it (such as the abstract objects) do not
exist, because these systems are not endowed with IPS which is able
to perceive and process this information.</P>

8.8.1: This fact has unexpected implications on our concepts
regarding some of the <I>abstract objects </I>(objects which shall be
defined and analyzed in the following chapter, but momentarily, they
are assimilated with the information contained within an ISS). One of
the most frequently mistakes made by the people is to assign a real
existence, free from their material support (ISS) to some abstract
objects, due to the simple reason that our brain can operate this
kind of separation between the objects properties, and it is also
able to detach them from the object to whom they were initially
assigned to, because each property is associated to a distinct
internal ISS. But what is happening in our brain is an information
processing, process which is quasi-total independent from the
external world (of brain) and whose results do not always have a
correspondent into the real, external world. The properties of MS, on
which the human IPS perceives and stores them into our memory, are
<U>nothing but properties</U> of some MS or of some real processes in
which MS are involved, but they are not real, material objects with
independent existence, just like they are considered in many
circumstances. One of the most frequent assignments of &ldquo;independent
existence&rdquo; is the time assignment (which according to the
objectual philosophy is a property of processes) or the energy
assignment (a property of the material fluxes), or of many other
similar properties. We are about to see that the time is <U>only a
property</U>, namely a property which is specific to the real
processes (it is the support attribute of the temporal
distributions), mostly of the periodical ones, where it is clearly
defined, but it is a property assigned to the <U>representation</U>
of the external objects (namely, of some internal ISS) by IPS, and
therefore, it is its <U>internal</U> attribute.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But, let us return to the association
of the semantic values on the support syntactic values. Because the
information processing operations take place inside IPS, we will
focus mostly on the association of that particular values on the
internal ISS. We have seen that ISS have (for a finite number of
elements from their composition) a finite variety of such possible
structures, and IPS must be able to distinguish (to separate) these
possible structures. We have also noticed that each possible
structure of internal ISS (each syntactic value) must be related to a
distinct semantic value - external information associated to this
structure. First, let us see who makes the assignment of the semantic
value to a specific syntactic value.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In case of AIPS, we have previously
mentioned that this assignment between the syntactic value of a
binary word and its meaning (semantic value) is artificially made, by
means of convention (a set of rules), either by the processor&rsquo;s
designer, for the instructions codes, or by the programmer, as
regards the type of processed data. As for the programmer, it is his
duty to find the proper semantic quantitative or qualitative value
which will be assigned to a certain word, this assignment being
completely indifferent for the current processors which are able to
separate only the <U>syntactic values</U> of internal ISS. In other
words, due to the universality of the computer applications, the
artificial processors cannot assign semantic values by their own to
the set of internal syntactic values.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for NIPS, the problem is totally
different. Since it is by far, the most notorious case, we shall talk
about the human IPS. Here, &ldquo;by construction&rdquo; there is a
qualitative differentiation of the information&rsquo;s input
channels, firstly, according to the general properties types (fluxes)
which are detected (the so-called sensory organs), and then,
according to specific properties to each sensory organ. The
separation based on the detected property type is mainly achieved
through the internal structure of the sensory cells (therefore,
through genetic differentiation), able to receive only a specific
flux type, or a specific flux property (such as the direction or the
frequency) and then, through the position of these cells, first,
against the organ&rsquo;s internal reference, and second, of the
organ against the body&rsquo;s internal reference. The most relevant
aspect is that, in case of NIPS, all the sensory cells of all the
sense organs operate simultaneously (in parallel), so as the neuron
chains at which they are connected. The reason why they must operate
under parallel and synchronic conditions shall be described later on.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
8.8.2: If a comparison would be carried out on a common current AIPS
which is able to operate with words of no more than 256 bits (the
word being made-up from the number of bits which the processor is
able to simultaneously process), then, the human &ldquo;processor&rdquo;
operates with words counting several hundred of millions elements
(elements which have also an internal structure which represents the
intensity of the elementary flux received by a single cell). Even in
case of the nowadays supercomputers with tens of thousands processors
set in parallel, the operations parallelism has as its sole purpose,
the rise of the processing speed and not the semantic separation of
the information fluxes.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the specific terminology
used in this paper, we may say that in case of neuronal NIPS, there
is an invariant spatial distribution of the elementary input units on
RBS of IPS (see the annex X.18), that is a distribution defined
against the body&rsquo;s internal reference system.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This general distribution of the
elementary input units into NIPS is divided in classes specialized on
a certain type of detected properties (fluxes), classes which will
form the specialized sensory organs, therefore, there is a defined
distribution (invariant as well) of the received semantic values,
distribution which is maintained until the entrance inside the brain.
Here, due to the interconnective access between neurons (of the
re-circulated fluxes between them), ISS exchanges may occur between
the semantic domains (which are disjoint until the entrance inside
the brain).</P>
