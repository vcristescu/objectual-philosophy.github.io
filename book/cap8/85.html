<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">8.5 Artificial
information processing systems</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">When we are talking
about artificial information processing systems (AIPS), most of our
readers would probably think to computers. Well, it is not the
computer which is the first system of this kind but&hellip; the
instruments for the measurement of different sizes (mass, length,
time, angle etc.), and these instruments are operational for
thousands of years, indeed, under primitive yet functional forms. Let
us not forget that the pyramids, the Egyptian, Greek and Roman
temples, all the wonders of the Ancient times have been built based
on such instruments. Besides, who can ever imagine the trade without
one of its basic tools- the balance- whose Roman version may be even
found nowadays.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">You will probably
ask yourselves, what is the relation between the weighing machines
and the information processing? Although it is not obvious at all,
there is one link, however: all the measuring instruments operate
with ISS, but this time, we are not dealing with internal ISS (of the
human IPS), but with the external ISS. For example, the angle between
the lead-weight wire and the edge of a wall was an indicator of the
deviation of that wall edge from the vertical direction; this wire
was therefore a verticality reference, an ISS of the local vertical
direction information, on which the mason was perceiving it with his
visual sense, being able to use it afterwards as an element in the
decision to continue the wall construction or to rebuild it. The
angle of the pointer within a weighing machine against a bench-mark
is also an external ISS, more precisely an indicator of the
information that the two weights placed on its scales are not equal.
The perception of the information which is contained into the
external ISS is made in this case with the visual system. In fact,
most of these external ISS are meant to the visual perception system,
that is the system through which the human receives an external
information amount which is much higher than the one captured through
his other senses.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">However, let us
return to the information processing. It is clear that the measuring
systems which were previously mentioned <U>were not making the
information processing by themselves</U>, but they were only
converting an attribute which was beyond the human&rsquo;s direct
perception range into another directly perceptible attribute. The
information processing was also made by the human brain, but based on
the information contained into the external ISS. The only common
element between the above-mentioned instruments and the artificial
processing systems is the presence of external ISS, material systems
which make-up the basis of any IPS, as we have seen in the previous
paragraph. The next step on the way to the artificial information
processing systems (AIPS) was the invention of the instruments which
were using the <I>memorizing</I> (storage) process of ISS, process
which is indispensable for the instruments which are based on a
counting (numbering) of a periodical process. For example, this kind
of process is specific to the mechanical clocks (with pendulum or
balance wheel) which are designed to count the cycles of a very
stable periodical process (oscillation of the pendulum or of the
balance wheel) and to display this number, either as an angle of some
pointers or digitally. This counting process has an universal
algorithm: the increment by an unit of an ISS which keeps stored the
number of the already finished periodical processes, starting from
the instrument&rsquo;s escapement setting moment. In case of the
mechanical clocks, that particular increment is made at the angular
position of a gear wheel, at every oscillation of the pendulum, by
advancing tooth by tooth and afterwards, the clock&rsquo;s mechanism
(ISS) shall convert this rotation in order to display minutes, hours,
etc.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Therefore, the time
measuring devices presented so far operate with ISS and use the
storage and increment of an ISS value in order to achieve their
specific functions. But the increment (modification) of the value of
an ISS is already an <U>operation of the information processing</U>
contained by that ISS, which is a basic operation, with no
result-based reaction, but which is still an operation. From the
mechanical clock, that is an AIPS with a single operation, up to AIPS
(mechanical as well) which is able to perform mathematical computing,
there was only one step&hellip;.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Nowadays, AIPS
systems are electronic (most of them, but there are also other
versions: fluidic, photonic etc.) which similarly with the natural
IPS, they have a structure with few types of elements which may be
found at all the AIPS versions. The essential elements, and these are
the <I>internal</I> ISS which in case of the electronic AIPS are free
electrical charges from conductor or semiconductor materials, charges
whose group attributes (intensity of the electrical or magnetic
field) are the attributes perceptible by IPS as an associated and
transmissible information. These internal ISS are able to circulate
across specific pre-established routes (<I>the internal communication
thoroughfare</I>) as specific internal fluxes of ISS, fluxes which
carry the associated information towards all the AIPS components.
Just like the natural IPS, the fluxes are also confined in a global
RBS, all the AIPS components being included inside this surface, and
the same as in case of other MS, its role is to isolate the system
from the unwanted fluxes (disturbing fluxes) which might disturb the
system&rsquo;s operation, and to provide the closure of the internal
fluxes. On this RBS, there are <I>specialized zones</I> which allow
the admission of external fluxes, or these fluxes may come out, and
in case of AIPS, these zones are referred to as &ldquo;ports&rdquo;,
and similarly with the natural IPS, they have selective permeability
for a specific flux type, permeability which is controlled from
inside of AIPS. In case of AIPS, these input or output fluxes are
also internal ISS fluxes (electric charges as well), therefore a
transfer of SSI between AIPS is possible, unlike the natural IPS
which are not able to communicate each other through internal ISS,
but only through conversion fluxes. Thus, a first advantage of AIPS
against the biotic IPS occurs, that is the possibility of their
interconnection<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>6</SUP></A>2
in order to make-up complex AIPS (systems which are distributed or
centralized AIPS).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">By returning to the
AIPS structure, the ISS input fluxes reach through the communication
thoroughfare to one or more <I>information processing units</I>, the
only types of AIPS components able to perceive the structure of the
internal ISS and to change this structure according to the
information processing rules. This processing unit (known as
<I>processor</I>, within the current systems) has a finite set of
elementary operations which are designed by construction, operations
which can be organized in finite sets known as <I>programs</I>. All
the operations performed by the processing unit have the internal ISS
as their operands (objects subjected to the operations), which are
either recently admitted into the system through one of the ports, or
they are already stored (memorized) ISS at locations (addresses)
known in various types of internal memory.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">All the operations
which are possible to occur in the processing unit take place
sequentially (time phased) based on an <I>internal clock</I> (tact
generator), whose internal information makes possible the
differentiation by the processor of the evolution trend of a process
and henceforth, of two state types of an ISS - the present and the
previous ones.</P>

	When we are talking about the impossibility of biotic IPS
	connection, we are referring to two or more neural IPS belonging to
	the same number of distinct organisms. But, inside a neural IPS of a
	specific organism, the neurons interconnection in networks is
	however a normal situation, even mandatory, for increasing the
	information processing abilities. This interconnection, achieved by
	means of synapses, which preserve the spatial separation of the
	neurons is made through unidirectional neuromediators fluxes.</P>
