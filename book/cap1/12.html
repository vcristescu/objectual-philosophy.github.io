<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">In order to
establish a hierarchy relation on the set of structure levels of
NAMS, we may use the inclusion relations of sets belonging to the
constitutive parts. According to the knowledge gathered so far, it is
known that all the systems with the structure level over AT level
(such as MO, NM, AB, PS, etc.) are made-up from AT systems,
therefore, it might be said that:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">{AT}set is made-up from two
	complementary subsets: the set of the atoms <U>bound </U>in
	molecules or other types of atomic systems (e.g.: metals) and the
	set of the <U>free</U> atoms (unbound in any system). The result is
	that the set of the atoms from the composition of the molecule set
	{AT<SUB>MO</SUB>}is included in {AT} set (see fig.1.2.1).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">{MO}set is also made-up from two
	subsets: the set of molecules arisen in natural media {MO<SUB>MN</SUB>}
	and the free molecules set, resulting that the set of molecules
	which make-up {MO<SUB>MN</SUB>}is included in {MO}, so on.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Taking
into consideration the figure 1.2.1, one may notice that there is an
inclusions chain of the abiotic systems set, chain which may be
represented by using the syntax of the sets theory, as it follows:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">	<IMG SRC="12_html_m72eb05c5.gif" NAME="Object3" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=269 HEIGHT=24>	(1.2.1)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">which means that the total atoms set
includes the set of the atoms embedded in molecules, which in its
turn, is made-up from the set of atoms from the natural media, etc.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Under a simplified
form, the relation 1.2.1 may be written as:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">	<IMG SRC="12_html_3574547b.gif" NAME="Object4" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=237 HEIGHT=21>	(1.2.2)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">or:</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">namely, the set of
atoms from the galaxy</SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">es&rsquo; composition
is finally included in the total set of the atoms from the universe
(with their intermediate organization levels, they are also subsets
of the atoms set. But, since it is known that the atoms are systems
made-up from EP, therefore, {AT}set is also included in the more
extended {EP}set, that is the set of all the electric particles from
the universe. Generalizing the inclusion relations 1.2.3 across the
entire NAMS hierarchy range mentioned in par. 1.1, it may be written
that:</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">which means that the set of the
electric particles which are found in the composition of the galaxy
clusters is included in the total set of EP from the universe, but
obviously, there is a set of EP which do not belong to any of their
structure forms (free particles from the space between the galactic
clusters).

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Definition
1.2.1</B>: The set of the systems with a more simple structure, whose
elements are at the origin of <U>all</U> the systems with a more
complex structure, is called the <B>generating set.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, according to the relation
1.2.4, a generating set is {EP} set, because EP systems are found in
the composition of all the material systems with a more complex
structure, including in the stars core, where even the atomic kernels
are dissociated. As for the biosystems from the Earth, it is also a
generating set which might be considered as the set of all the living
cells from the planet (either they are free, as bacteria, or bound,
as the tissue cells), but also the set of the atoms found in the
peripheral media of the planet, from which all the constitutive parts
of a bio-system (including the cellular one) will arise.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any subset belonging to a set is
characterized by the fact that its constitutive elements have at
least one distinctive feature as compared to the elements of the
generating set (that is the set where the subset is included). In
case of NAMS, this kind of feature is for instance, the spatial
location of the elements, the atoms of a molecule being confined in a
limited space, that is the molecular space. The group of properties
which define a certain subset from series 1.2.4. shall be
(temporarily) called as the formation criteria of the subset (system)
and it is the main property of the organization level notion of that
particular system. The result is that a system with a certain
organization level implies the existence of some systems with an
inferior organization degree. This chain implication (propositional)
may be written in an abbreviated form by using the implication
operator [&rarr;]:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">	<IMG SRC="12_html_46df4cae.gif" NAME="Object7" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=449 HEIGHT=19>	(1.2.5)
     
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Relation 1.2.5 may
be read as it follows:</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"> &ldquo;<I>The
existence of GC-type systems implies the existence (as subsystems) of
GX-type subsystems, which also implies the existence of PS-type
systems,</I> etc.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">But the same
relation may be also read as: &ldquo;<I>EP systems are the subsystems
for NC, which in their turn, are subsystems for AT</I>&rdquo;, so on.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">One may notice that
the question marks delimit the current cognition limits in the
abiotic field (we are talking about the certain, experimental
cognition which is unanimously recognized by all the scientists). If
we shall mark the same series of the systemic implications
(organizational) of NAMS according to the knowledge degree at the end
of 19-th century, we shall get:</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(by mentioning that the
only PS system which was known was our planetary system), and in
antiquity, the chain of the organizational implications was only:
