<H2 CLASS="western">1.5 Void acording to the systemic concept</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">At a certain
moment, there will be a mixture (reunion) of material systems with
various organization levels found in a limited examination volume
(precinct). It might be assumed that this volume has a dimension
which allows only MO-type or less-sized systems (AT, NC, EP etc.) to
be placed inside it. However, in case of MO and AT systems, this
system shall comprise - under atmospheric pressure conditions - a
significant number of specimens. We may assume that the number
(cardinal) associated to each set of systems with XY organization
level would be known (where XY may take one of AT, MO, EP values,
etc) which may be included into the examination zone; these are
finite sets (the examination zone is finite). If the set of XY
systems is void (null cardinal), it might be stated that the
examination zone is a &ldquo;XY systems void&rdquo;. Practically, the
void (vacuum) is a space from which AT-type systems or the larger
systems should miss.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Some observations
need to be promptly made:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The &ldquo;void&rdquo; notion is <U>a
	property of a confined space</U> (of a precinct), that is the
	incapacity of containing a certain type of objects (the set of the
	contained objects is void);</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This property is relative at a
	reference which consists of a certain organization level of the
	systems removed from the precinct. For example, a sterile space is a
	precinct where there is no kind of living bio-system (we may
	consider that the precinct is void from living organisms, regardless
	of their organization degree). If the intention is to create a space
	void from AT systems, then, these systems (reference level) and the
	ones with a higher level of organization should not be present in
	that space.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is very difficult to
	effectively build a space which is completely without MO or AT
	systems, therefore, a compromise is made: the decrease of AT systems
	number from the voided space under a certain value (indirectly
	determined by means of pressure). This value of the pressure from
	the precinct becomes the <I>void degree</I>, or, as a noun, &ldquo;the
	void&rdquo;. The people have a tendency (wrong) to separate the
	properties of some objects from their holder, as if these properties
	would be able to have a free existence. This is what it happened
	with the void.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even under the hypothetic
	situation of a perfect void realization of AT systems, this void
	refers to AT or to larger systems, but not also to the systems with
	a lower organization level, and obviously, with much small sizes
	(NC, EP etc.);</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If as a result of using special
	techniques, a void would be created at EP level, it still cannot be
	stated that this space does not include material systems with deeper
	organization levels (currently unknown).</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.2in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
1.5.1: If we take as example an empty flat room (vacuumed from any
abiotic or biotic objects) this &ldquo;void&rdquo; refers to the
macroscopic, visible objects, but not to the huge number of gas
molecules from that room, which our senses are not able to detect
them directly. The situation with the void at EP level is absolutely
similar, the current scientific means being unable to reveal the
existence of PBM elements.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As a consequence of
the above mentioned issues, SOP acceptance leads to the denial of the
absolute void existence (of a space where there is no kind of
material system). Likewise, a property of a finite space, that is the
capacity of containing a low or null number of atoms, cannot be
considered as a basis for deploying real propagation processes, such
as the propagation of photons, of the electromagnetic waves or of the
gravity interactions.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The fact that
Michelson-Morley experiment did not reveal a motion against the ether
at the surface of the Earth, it is not necessarily a proof that the
ether does not exist, but rather a proof that our mental model
regarding this medium and regarding what propagation or displacement
really mean in relation to it was not correct at that moment. On
another occasion, we shall see that the objectual philosophy proposes
another interpretation of the properties of this medium.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">However, a barren
foray through the field of mathematical definitions of the basic
concepts belonging to the structure of the objectual philosophy needs
to be done next. There is an attempt in making a compromise between
rigor and conciseness for presenting these mathematical models, so
that the reader to understand fast and easy <U>the essence</U> of the
presented concepts. Due to these reasons, the presentation style is
different from the style of classic mathematical papers, although the
mathematical models are approached.</P>
