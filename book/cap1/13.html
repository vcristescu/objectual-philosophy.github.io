<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">There are few
important conclusions which may derive from the above-mentioned
facts:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number of the hierarchical
	structure levels of the abiotic matter, accepted by the scientists,
	depend on the knowledge amount accumulated at a certain moment;</P>

	organization level (the most simple) at a certain level of the
	general knowledge, are called &ldquo;elementary&rdquo; or
	&ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo;. They are constitutive parts of all the
	systems with a superior structure (making-up the <I>generating set</I>
	of all these systems).</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The order of
magnitude (see annex X.1) of the spatial dimensions of EP systems is
about 10<SUP>-14</SUP> m, and of GX system is approx. 10<SUP>21</SUP>
m. Therefore, the abiotic matter organization within systems is
maintained along an interval of over 35 orders of magnitude of the
spatial dimensions. We must also take into account that the systemic
matter organization was not known in the ancient times as we know it
nowadays, but this does not mean that it did not actually exist.
These findings give us the right to assert that:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There is no logical argument able

1.3.1: As we are about to see later in this book, the matter (or more
exactly, the material systems class) is divided in three large
subclasses: - <I>abiotic systems</I> (natural), <I>biotic systems</I>
and <I>artificial systems</I>. According to the aforementioned
issues, some elements of the abiotic class hierarchy (such as the
atoms) make-up the generating set also for the other two classes of
material systems. SOP is unconditionally valid (according to the
objectual philosophy) in case of the class of the natural abiotic
systems, fact which results from the model of this kind of system,
model which shall be analyzed in section 7. As for the classes of
biotic and artificial systems, although they are also material
systems, there are some properties which restrict their divisibility
range; in case of such systems, there are basic elements which cannot
be decomposed any more without loosing the class features, despite of
the high cognition level. But these elements are further decomposed
as an abiotic support of the biotic or artificial systems. For the
attentive and detail-oriented reader, an apparent contradiction might
arise between SOP and the division way of the abiotic MS in elements
which make-up systems and the free ones, division which was used at
the beginning of paragr. 1.2. There is indeed a fraction of MS which
does not belong to many forms of organization from the above
mentioned hierarchy, although there is always an organization
structure which shall also include them. For example, the fractions
belonging to free EP, unbound within the nucleus, atoms, media, may
be part of an inter-planetary, inter-galactic medium, and they shall
be compulsorily part of our universe, which is also a MS. The set of
the free living cells (unbound into the multicellular organisms)
shall be ultimately part of the planetary biosphere, the biggest
bio-system known so far. If the first version of SOP (version <B>a</B>)
has a generality level which depends on MS class (as it was above
mentioned in this comment), the version <B>b</B> of SOP is
universally-valid and it is one of the basic principles of this
paper.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
