<H2 CLASS="western">1.4 Some philosophical implications of SOP
acceptance</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Although it is not
too obvious at a first seeing, the implications of the acceptance of
this principle on the concepts regarding the world are very numerous
and they cover all the cognition fields.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">First of all, this
principle postulates the divisibility in other systems of the abiotic
material systems already known as &ldquo;elementary&rdquo;, without
mentioning a limit for this divisibility (maybe even up to infinity).
Secondly, at the opposite end of cognition, towards more and more
large systems, this principle postulates the spatial finity of our
Universe as an <I>object,</I> but it does not contradict the
simultaneous existence of other similar universes which are spatially
disjoint and also organized in larger systems. But, pay attention, we
are not talking about the so-called &ldquo;parallel universes&rdquo;
from SF slang, but about some entities which are similar to our
universe, with clear spatial boundaries, yet located at unthinkable
distances, unthinkable as the real dimensions of our own universe
are, from which only a small fraction is visible.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.2in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
1.4.1: The problem of accepting the idea of the existence of other
universes is similar with the problem of the simultaneous existence
of other planets, besides Earth, <U>in our solar system</U>. There
was a time in the history of human cognition when this existence was
denied, obviously due to lack of information (knowledge). Nowadays,
since this problem was solved, we are now in the early stage of
accepting the simultaneous existence of other planetary systems
within our galaxy, acceptance which is rather difficult because there
are no direct data concerning these particular objects, and the
current scientific philosophy does not provide any clue in supporting
the prediction on the existence of this kind of objects <U>around
each observable star</U>.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another consequence of SOP application
is the prediction on the existence of other media generation, (also
belonging to the abiotic category), made-up from much smaller systems
as compared to any EP, the set of this elements being a generating
set for {EP} set. These media, which are called <I>&ldquo;proximate
basic media&rdquo;</I> (PBM)<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
are the components of the universe, in the same way as NM are the
components of AB. We are using the term &ldquo;media&rdquo; instead
of &ldquo;medium&rdquo; because (according to the objectual
philosophy) these media can also exist in various states (just like
NM), either solid, liquid or gaseous. The acceptance of the existence
of these media<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
is currently a difficult task, the most significant disproof coming
once with the release of the results of Michelson-Morley experiment
and continuing up to the present. Unfortunately for the human
cognition, the hasty interpretation of this result which has led to
this disproof, was (according to the author) a huge step backwards,
step which led to the drastic limitation of the mankind access to the
space, by only using the inertial propulsion equipment for space
ships.</P>

	There were called <I>proximate</I> because if their existence would
	be demonstrated, this fact is itself a proof that there will also be
	other &ldquo;much more basic&rdquo; hierarchical media levels. The
	&ldquo;proximate&rdquo;attribute refers to the proximity to NM (in
	hierarchical order), the only types of abiotic media which are known
	so far.</P>

	Media whose existence was not contested in the 19-th century (under
	ether state), and even the existence of the ether as fluid and of
	the analogy between the fluid mechanics law and the laws on
	electromagnetic phenomena have led to the elaboration of Maxwell&rsquo;s
	equations, which are the basis of electrotechnics, and we might say,
	are the basis of current technical civilisation.</P>
