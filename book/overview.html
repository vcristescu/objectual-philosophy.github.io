OVERVIEW AND LANGUAGE CONVENTION</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>The systemic approach on the world
implies, first of all, the structural hierarchy of the forms
revealing all the constitutive elements of the world as we know it. A
simple classification of these &ldquo;systematization forms&rdquo;
depending on the complexity degrees of the elements which make-up the
world is not a new endeavor, and it is not enough for understanding
the causes of this hierarchy, that is the structure of the
surrounding material systems and of the systems from whom even
ourselves are made-up. </I>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Our duty is to discover the most
general laws which are the basis of this entirely systemic structure,
laws which define both the formation of the natural systems and their
decomposition.</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>The paper herein tries to present
these possible laws and principles, which, if accepted, they allow us
to understand our world in a way which is both nonconformist and
coherent. The present work was written mainly for the readers with
higher education, with basic knowledge in the special mathematics,
and with a broad and interdisciplinary scientific background.</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>The objectual approach of the
cognition according to the principles defined in this paper is meant
to create a new scientific way of thinking, which, if it is used </I><I><U>with
discernment</U></I><I> and competence, becomes a means able to
provide a special analysis and prediction capacity. The work has a
prevalent qualitative character, following that, many of the quantity
aspects of the depicted objects and processes to be subsequently
settled, after the moment when the qualitative principles have became
a working method.</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Due to the fact that the meaning
given by the author to some terms is mostly different as compared to
the meaning from the current natural language (even scientific
language), some </I><I><B>reserved words and expressions </B></I><I>were
introduced across the work contents, namely, some words or
expressions (collocations) with a semantic value (meaning) which is
invariant and context-free, value which is defined at the proper
moment of the exposure. These words and expressions are also included
in the list of reserved words which is found at the end of the paper,
where there are hyperlinks to the definition of that particular word.
The reader is warned that none of the terms which are considered as
&ldquo;tabu&rdquo; by most of the scientists, such as, energy, force,
pressure, field and many others, will not be neglected but they shall
be redefined.</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I><B>	</B></I><I>In order to increase
the amount of information which is communicated to the reader by
means of limiting the semantic field of a notion (notion area), the
intersection of the semantic fields of some similar notions shall be
used. The term whose meaning is desired to be restricted (defined)
shall be followed by a list with similar notions, placed in brackets,
and the common meaning of these notions is the meaning desired to be
transmitted to the reader. For example, the expression </I>motion
(transfer, displacement)<I> is used in order to communicate the
common meaning of the three words (intersection of the semantic
fields).</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>	As for the notation which is used,
the scalar quantities shall be written with italics (e.g: V, dM, t,
so on), and the vector quantities shall be written with bold
characters (e.g: </I><I><B>v, f, </B></I>so on<I>) within the text,
or overlined characters in some relations written with other editor
(for example, 
<IMG SRC="overview_html_m4f375aea.gif" NAME="Object1" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=20>).
The index of paragraphs, definitions, figures, comments and relations
within the text are composed according to the following rule:</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<I>[section no]. [paragraph no].&lt;subparagraph no&gt;[current no]</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>where the brackets [] show a
compulsory index and &lt;&gt;, an optional one.</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>The work is divided in two fluxes:
the main flux, made-up from the succession of chapters 1&hellip;9,
where the basic concepts and principles of the objectual philosophy
are exposed (we may consider this part as the spinal cord of the
work), and the secondary flux, made-up from a number of annexes,
which are far from being less-significant, but they are either
detailed explanations of the concepts from the main flux (which were
taken-out from this stream for not distracting the reader&rsquo;s
attention too much), or the application of the principles of the
present work under the re-interpretation of some objects or processes
from the real or abstract world.</I></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><I>The
additional explanations related to the text, required by some of the
concepts or assertions, are structured on four levels of complexity:
short explanations placed in brackets, footnotes, comments and (as
mentioned above) annexes. The basic rule taken into account for
drawing-up the text is that the neglecting of the additional
explanations does not impair the paper coherence. In other words, if
the text from brackets, footnotes and comments is not taken into
consideration, the remaining one must be coherent, but it will depict
only the minimum necessary information.</I></P>
