SENSORIAL DISTRIBUTIONS</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">X.18.1 <SPAN LANG="en-US">Sensory cell
distributions as objects</SPAN></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In chapter 8 we have discussed about
the sensory organs, their types and material flux types received by
these. We saw that these organs make-up the information&rsquo;s input
units into NIPS and at the moment of their output an ISS flux is
released, which depends on the external material flux which is
incident on the sensory organ. Therefore, functionally speaking, a
sensory input unit is a flux converter (transformer): an external
flux with a specific spatial, temporal or frequential distribution
and a specific intensity, all of these existing at a specific moment
<I>t</I>, will generate an ISS flux with a certain structure, a
certain spatial distribution and a certain intensity, all existing at
the moment <I>t+&Delta;t</I>, where <I>&Delta;t</I> is the temporal
interval required for the flux conversion (interval which is
momentarily let aside because it is not relevant for the topic of
this annex).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each sensory organ is made-up from a
finite and invariant number of sensory cells which are specialized in
receiving a certain type of external material flux, cells which are
spatially distributed in certain areas placed either on the body&rsquo;s
RBS or inside it. The distribution of the sensory cells for a
specific organ and organism are provided by the genetic code of the
biosystem species to which the organism belongs to, and these
distributions are invariant throughout its entire life time, and
identical for all the normal specimens of that species. Each of these
distributions has, objectually speaking, all the properties within
the general object model presented in chapter 3:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	P1	The set of distributed attributes
is related to the set of sensory cells which are part from the
structure of that organ, each type of cell receiving a specific

uneven, in fovea (visual center, origin of the retina&rsquo;s
internal RS) the cones are prevalent and the rods are more numerous
at the peripherical area. The rods are reference cells as regards the
intensity of the light flux and they are not sensitive at a specific
color; at the same time, they have a much faster response than the
cones, being suitable for detecting the motion in a peripherical
visual field.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

X.18.1.2: The internal spatial reference system of the animal
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">organism is generally made-up from the
anterior-posterior axis (axis of the digestive tract), which is
crossed by two perpendicular planes and each of them separates two
half-spaces: left-right and ventral-dorsal. At the middle of the
axis, another perpendicular plane which is placed on the other two
separates the anterior-posterior half-spaces. In case of humans,
because of their bipedal position, the anterior-posterior axis has
become vertical (local direction of the gravity field gradient), the
anterior-posterior half-spaces being changed in an up-down
half-spaces. This is an artificial RS, useful for defining the
anatomic position of the organs or cells by the humans; the real
internal spatial (natural) RS, used by the intra-cellular processing
systems of the genetic code for establishing the position of each
cell is yet unknown.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	P4	<FONT COLOR="#000000">The amount of

organ is also established by means of the genetic code, through the

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	P5	<FONT COLOR="#000000">The internal
reference system is also established by means of the genetic code,
through the existence of either a spatial RS which is specific to the
sensory organ against which the position of each sensory cell is
being settled (for example, the case of the retina or of the Corti
organ), or a global spatial RS of the organism (for the sensory cells
placed into the epidermis);</FONT></P>

moment of the IPS inside the organism.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">An
elementary sensory flux (elementary sensation) is found at the output
(axon) of each sensory cell, with an intensity depending on the
intensity of the elementary flux incident on the cell. On the way
between the sensory cell and the central nervous system (the brain),
the spatial relative positions of these nervous endings within the
same sensory organ are being preserved, so that the spatial
distribution of the cells from the sensory organ determines a spatial
distribution which is a conformable representation of the elementary
fluxes which have reached to the brain. At the same time, each
sensory organ has an associated (reserved) cortical area with an
invariant position against the internal RS of the brain. Finally,
there will be the same number of cortical spatial distributions as
the number of the body&rsquo;s sensory organs, each with its own
spatial domain and with the distribution type of the elementary
sensations generated by the distribution of the received external
fluxes.</FONT></P>
