shall use the same method that was used in the chapter 1 for
displaying the organization levels of NAMS, in which the organization
levels are colligated by means of the operator </FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">[</SPAN><IMG SRC="x113_html_3c7003db.gif" NAME="Object812" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=15><SPAN LANG="en-GB">]

X.11.3.1: The reader has certainly noticed that unlike the relation
1.2.3 from chapter 1, the relation X.11.3.2 lacks of the question
marks which trace the possible limits of the organization levels
applicable for NAMS. It is natural because BMS have a lower limit of
the decomposition level (there are elementary systems regardless of
the cognition level), as it revealed by the issues presented in this
annex. On the planet, there is also a maximum limit in terms of
composability, which is dictated by the sizes of the peripheral media
of the resident planet, media in which PBS is distributed. While as
regards the lower limit of the BMS&rsquo; organization, the objectual
philosophy clearly postulates that in case of the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><U>BMS
with atomic abiotic support</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">, PC
biosystems are elementary systems, as regards the upper limit, it is
likely to exist some systems made-up from different PBS, placed in
the same PS (what the scientists are doing now by trying to colonize
the Moon and Mars), or in different PS, under the assumption of a
technological lap which would be sufficient for ensuring the
biosystems fluxes on astronomical distances. The previous underlining
has a specific purpose, that is to represent that a lower limit of
the organization levels can be noticed in case of a certain
environment of existence, made-up from NAMS with a specific
organization level (in case of the notorious bio-systems, this is a
L</SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-US">A</SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-US">
medium - the water - as it was previously mentioned). As for another
media generation, such as PFM, and similar with the way how NAMS were
created, the possibility of occurring another biosystem generation
which owns the PFM elements as its abiotic support shall not be let
aside as well.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">We
may notice further on that the PC, EC and OG systems are all
centralized (CS, all the cellular functions are controlled by a
cellular or neuronal IPS which exists inside the nucleus), and CM,
OGM and PBS systems are distributed systems (DS, in which there is no
interactions except the ones deployed between the proximity elements.
Thus, an interesting alternation of the system types occurs into the
structural chain:</FONT></P>

(X.11.3.3)</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">The
reader must understand that this structural chain has no connection
with the taxonomic classifications</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> which
are stated in the biology field, classifications which are focused
more on the reigns, orders, species etc. It is clear that these
categorizations are useful because they emphasize the common and
different elements of the various biosystem classes, but these do not
concern the organization levels.</SPAN></P>
