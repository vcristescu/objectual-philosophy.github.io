Conclusions</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
complementarity in case of the natural distributions requires the
existence of an attribute which has values unevenly distributed on a
support domain, the reference value being the mean value (the
support&rsquo;s internal reference). By considering this reference
value, some values show a property &ldquo;deficit&rdquo; while others
are characterized by a property &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The same
situation is found in case of the distribution of the human
attributes (qualities) on the set of the individuals belonging to a
society; all the qualities of an individual are being evaluated (by
himself or by other members of the society) by making a comparison of
each quality with a reference value specific to a certain society,
and a reference is always existent - that is the mean value of the
support attribute</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>9</SUP></A>7</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">-
against which the two segments of the above-mentioned set may be
distinguished: with property deficit or with surplus property.
Because most of the distributions deployed by these attributes take
place as a result of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>natural</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
processes (self-settle by means of repeated bilateral interactions or
by means of the specific individual components of the human genetic
code), according to the objectual philosophy,  the reference in
question (mean value) is referred to as </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>natural
reference</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">For example, the
complementary attributes occur at the moment of the distribution of
the instantaneous velocity on the set of gas molecules (either lower
speed rates or higher than the average values), the distribution of
intellectual abilities (stupid-clever) on the set of the individuals
belonging to a social group, esthetic appearance (ugly-beautiful),
muscular strength (weak-strong), etc. In most of the cases, the
people have assigned different names for the two property types,
although the two complementary properties are </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>facets
of the same distributed property</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
but with domains of the support&rsquo;s quantitative values on both
sides of a natural reference. By making a more increased
generalization and by extending the dichotomic classification
(against a natural reference as well) to all the types of human
behavior, we finally reach to the concepts of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>evil</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>good</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
which are certainly determined against a natural reference - an
average human behavior, obtained as a result of the mediation between
more behaviors of different populations, on periods of time for which
stored data are available.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The complementary
properties are basic examples of the existence of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>quality
difference</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> of a property,
exclusively based on the sign of a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>quantity
difference</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> (against the reference
value). If we observe that the Gauss distribution of an attribute has
an unique support domain which is dichotomically divided in two
sub-domains by the internal reference (natural mean value), in that
case we could find that the two opposite qualities are nothing else
but the same property, but distributed on adjacent-disjoint support
domains.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
complementarity concept which was previously analyzed allows us to
operate with new abstract objects (presented in chapter 9), such as
the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>absolute reality</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
as a basis for two complementary abstract objects: the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>known
reality</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> (made-up from the total
amount of MS and of the real processes with simultaneous existence
for which the mankind owns specific information at a certain moment),
and the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>unknown reality</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
(the rest of MS and of their associated processes, with a
simultaneous existence, yet unknown by the mankind).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
non-contradiction principle, exclusively applicable under the
conditions of a dichotomic classification of a set of objects with
simultaneous existence is a very old principle, accepted without
hesitations by the entire scientific community, but yet unreasonably
ignored in some cases. A notorious example of non-application of the
non-contradiction principle may be found in the classic physics where
the simultaneous existence </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>at the
same object</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> (for example, a material
point) of the position and velocity (or of the impulse) is (still)
accepted. But, my dear reader, the velocity implies the variation of
the position of that particular point; how can it be possible to
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>simultaneously</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
exist two opposite attributes - an invariant attribute (position) and
a variation of the attribute (velocity)? Does it mean that an
attribute may be constant and variable at the same moment </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>t</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">?
This error of the classic physics comes from another error of a
similar kind, but which this time may be found in mathematics - the
existence of the derivative </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>in a
point</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> (namely, the existence of a
variation - derivative - at the same time with the existence of an
invariant value - the function value in that particular point (see
also the annex X.3).</FONT><BR>
