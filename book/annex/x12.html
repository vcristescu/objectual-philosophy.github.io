<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">In chapter 4, we
have seen</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> what are the definitions of an
object&rsquo;s state or of an even process, as well as the types of
the processual states which are coming from this kind of definition.
Based on these definitions, and on the fact that the assessment of
each state type is made against a reference system, and on the fact
that the object whose state is assessed may be a complex object,
there are also other state classes which can be defined.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">When we</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
have discussed about objects, we saw that their properties are
determined first of all against an internal reference system and in
this case, we are dealing with some </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>internal
properties.</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> All the properties of an
object are also determined against a reference which is outside the
object and that is why they are called </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>external
properties</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">. Let us remember the
definition 3.1.3 which was given to the notion of object: The object
is a finite and invariant set of qualitative attributes (properties),
with simultaneous, finite and invariant distributions, on the same
finite and invariant support domain, which are determined against a
common internal reference system. If the set of the attributes of an
object is made-up from </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>m</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
properties, each element </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>x</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>k</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
of the common support will be associated with </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>m</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
values of the distributed attributes which are related to that
particular element by means of </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>m</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
assignment relations.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">According to the
definition 4.2.1, all the existing (distributed) invariant attributes
on an element </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>x</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>k</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">

</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">object at the value </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>x</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>k</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
of that particular support. In chapter 2, we saw that the support
element may be a singular value, that is a case when we are dealing
with a primary distribution, or an elementary interval of values
(with an internal reference </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>x</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>k</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">),
and in this case we are dealing with a derived distribution (of a
primary distribution). In chapter 4, we saw that the state applicable
to a singular value of the support is a state </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>S</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>0</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
(state of a primary distribution element), and the one which is
related to a support finite interval is a state </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>S</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>n</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">,
where </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>n</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"> is
the rank of the finite difference distributed on the elementary
interval </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">Because any of the
above-mentioned states, either </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>S</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>0</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>
</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">or </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>S</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>n</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
represents a set of properties belonging to a certain element of the
support attribute, all of these will be considered as </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I><B>local

support element</SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I> x</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>k</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">,
or to the elementary interval with an internal reference at </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>x</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>k</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">)
of the object with the above mentioned </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>m</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
properties.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">The </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">evaluation
of the value of the local states attributes can be done, as we have
previously pointed out, against a reference system inside the object,
when we shall be dealing  with </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I><B>internal
</B></I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">(local) </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I><B>states</B></I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">,
or against an external reference system, when we shall be dealing
with </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I><B>external states</B></I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
(local as well).</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">We were previously
saying that the local states are states </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>specific</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
to a certain distribution element, either primary or derived
distribution which belong to an object. The </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>m</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
distributions which belong to an object </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>Ob</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
with </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>m</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
qualitative properties in set, have a finite number of elements (for
the realizable distributions): the number of normal singular values
corresponding to the primary distributions, or the number of
elementary intervals in which the support is divided, concerning the
derived distributions. In chapter 3, we saw that the elements of a
distribution are elementary objects at the same time, therefore, the
object </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>Ob </I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">is
an object composed from a set of elementary objects, each with its
own </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>m</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
properties which are provided by means of the assignment relations.
Since all the properties of an elementary object are specific (local)
properties, they all have a common component, aspect which was
presented in chapter 3, the reference value against which these
properties are evaluated, that is a value which belongs to the
internal reference system of the object </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>Ob</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">.
We have also noticed in chapter 3 that this reference value valid for
an isolated object has a null value </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>(absolute
reference</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">), and for an object which
deploys relations with other external objects, its value shall be
established against an external reference, common to all the objects
which develop mutual relations, and it becomes a </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>relative
reference</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">. In this case, the set of
objects which deploy external relations makes-up a complex object,
the composition relations being created between the internal
reference systems of each constitutive object, and as a result of the
existence of such relations, each internal reference shall be
assigned with a non-zero value. But, this means that there is a set
of dependence relations deployed between the values of the internal
references of the constitutive objects and the external reference,
set which will make-up a new distribution, which represents the
complex object.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">The total amount of
properties assigned to the internal RS of a complex object against
the external reference makes-up an external state of this RS, and
because that state is common to all the internal elements of the
complex object, it will be a </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I><B>global
state</B></I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"> of this object.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">As a conclusion, an
amount which is placed inside an invariant confined surface may be
chara</SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">cterized from two points of view -
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>local</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"> and
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>global.</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">
The local characterization is  given by the elements of the spatial
distribution of that amount inside the surface (mostly by their
density), and the global one is given by the integral of this
distribution (the total attribute amount distributed into the inner
volume, that is the attribute </SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><I>stockpile</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO">),
or by the internal RS of the distribution. As for the distributed 
processes, the local characterization is made by SEP (the element of
Euler distribution), and the global one is given by the resultant of
the vectors&rsquo; distribution (which is also the result of an
integration).</SPAN></P>
