Mechanical perturbation of the bound EP states</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">So far, we have
discussed about the perturbation occurred on the state of a bound EP,
generated by a photonic flux. Let us imagine that a complete atom
which has all its model elements, which means that it is not even
partly dissociated (ionized) is neuter </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">in
terms of electricity, that is, its outer electric field is null
(practically ranging from few Van der Waals radii to infinity). This
mean that </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>from electrical p.o.v.</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,
two neuter atoms do not interact at all if they are placed at a
certain distance over that limit, and if we let aside the
gravitational interaction, the two atoms may be considered as
isolated. Since they are isolated, by assuming that they have an
initial kinetic energy and with all the freedom degrees, it must
exist a barrier which has to turn them away when they reach it (a
RBS), having the role to keep them in a specific volume, and this is
the way how the two atoms will make-up a G system. Besides the
interaction with the maintenance barrier (which will be momentarily
let aside), there is a probability different from zero that the two
atoms to intersect their pathways, which means to collide one
another. Well, this collision is the moment we were waiting for!</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">With all the
apologies for the boring and finical approach, we have to minutely
analyze this collision process of two neuter atoms</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,
and you will see that the outcome of this review worths all the
efforts. Due to simplicity reasons, we may assume that the two atoms
are identical and belong to an inert gas (namely, they do not make-up
molecular systems as a result of collision), that the velocity before
the collision is equal and with opposite directions, and that we are
dealing with an axial collision. As we said before, until the moment
when the neuter atoms reach to a distance of several Van der Waals
radii (about 10</SPAN><SUP><SPAN LANG="en-GB">-5</SPAN></SUP><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
m), their interaction is insignificant, but once they are close to
this distance, the electric field (residual) of the electrons from
the composition of the external layers of both atoms starts to
manifest. But, it is too late, the two atoms with their kinetic
translation energy (as regards the collision, these are the only ones
which matters) have been already intersecting their bounding surfaces
made-up exclusively from the fluxes of the electrons belonging to the
external layers. This inter-penetration of the two electronic media
takes place until the initial kinetic coherent flux (impulse) of the
atoms is totally converted into a stochastic flux (compression flux,
without the component T) of the elements belonging to the two atoms,
and this is the moment when the two atoms remain perplexed (#) and
motionless, and then, the stochastic fluxes stored in the two atoms
shall be turned into kinetic (coherent) fluxes, the two atoms moving
along opposite directions as compared to the initial ones. But, my
dear reader, the forced penetration of the two electronic media means
a real disaster for the above-mentioned synchronism of EP placed on
the fundamental orbitals, each electron which is involved in
collision must absorb a part of the atomic kinetic flux. After the
collision is completed, each of these disturbed electrons will
release a photon in order to return to the fundamental state; and
because the share of EF received by each of them is not the same, the
released photons will have different frequency and emission
directions. Therefore, in case of a collision between two atoms, even
if it is &ldquo;perfectly elastic&rdquo;, as it is considered the
collision between two atoms of inert gas, besides the kinetic fluxes
involved in collision, there are also two &ldquo;bouquets&rdquo; of
different photons (released by both atoms).</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Well, according to
the objectual philosophy, these photons make-up </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I><B>the
class of thermal photons, </B></I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">that is a
type of atomic photons produced rather by means of &ldquo;mechanic&rdquo;
excitation than by means of photonic excitation, as a result of
collision, vibration processes, generally, after a relative motion of
an atom against its neighbours, with consequences on the state of the
peripheral electronic medium of the atoms, or of the systems made-up
from atoms, processes which lead to the mutual perturbation of the
state of electrons which are located on the external layers of the
atoms.</SPAN></P>
