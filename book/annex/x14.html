is based on the fact that all the properties which are found into the
model set of an external object must be transmissible properties,
which means that these properties may be transferred (carried) by
some fluxes. A certain type of flux, for instance, a photon flux is
able to carry properties such as: photon frequency (which is
preserved into a homogeneous medium and for non-astronomic
distances), the direction of the photon flux (which is preserved into
a homogeneous medium with evenly distributed parameters), flux
intensity (that is the number of photons received per time unit) etc.
After their conversion into IPS, these properties become associated
to the agent object: colour, spatial position (against the internal
spatial RS of IPS), brightness (shining) etc.</SPAN></P>

shortest the domain of this localization is, the better is the domain
resolution (within the distribution&rsquo;s support domain) of the
detecting system. Because into the point domain (PD) of the process
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="ro-RO"><B>B</B></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">, there
is no possibility of distinguishing an internal distribution, the
distribution on this domain shall be considered as even (even if in
reality it can be however uneven).</SPAN></P>

X.14.1: An example of this kind of </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">point
like</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> process is the detection process which
occurs in a cell of a human sensory organ. This kind of cell receives
an external flux from the specialized qualitative cell domain (a
photon flux from the visible domain for the retina cells, an acoustic
flux for the cells of Corti organ, a thermal photons flux for the
thermo-receiver cells etc.). As a result of receiving (transmitting)
that particular flux through the cell&rsquo;s RBS, the flux action
occurs, that is the information exit flux, with the intensity
proportional with the intensity of the agent flux. Because a cell
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">cannot perceive the distribution of the
incident flux on it, but only its global intensity through the
cellular RBS across the cell domain, the distribution of the external
flux is considered as even, therefore, a sensory cell perceives an
elementary flux. An adjacent cell shall also receive an elementary
flux from an area which is adjacent with the area of the first cell,
and it will provide an information output flux which is proportional
with the intensity of this flux. Thus, the total amount of the
sensory cells of a specific organ shall provide at the exit a spatial
distribution of some information fluxes which are proportional with
the spatial distribution of the external fluxes, incident on the
sensory organ. Since the external fluxes are produced by some
external objects (agent objects), and these fluxes carry some
properties of these objects, the distribution of the information
fluxes provided by a sensory organ at a specific moment is an
abstract object, an </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>internal
representation</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"> of the state of the
external objects whose fluxes have been received. Obviously, when we
are talking about the state of the external objects as the total
amount of the invariant properties of these objects, we are referring
to those or that property which can be detected by the sensory organ.
For a more accurate representation of the real state of an external
object, a cumulation (qualitative composition) of the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><U>simultaneous</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">
representations of that object provided by all the sensory organs
belonging to the organism and which receive fluxes from that
particular object. This is the main reason of the objectual
philosophy for upholding the synchronic perception, at the same
internal tact impulse (that is the equivalent of a sampling impulse)
of all the sensory organs belonging to a specific organism.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The process </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>C</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
is a process of comparison and qualitative evaluation of the
difference between two values of the intensity deployed by the
elementary information fluxes, supplied by two cells of the same
sensory organ, if the cells are adjacent, the result of this
operation (the contrast) is the attribute distributed on another type
of support element - the domain (interval) between the internal
references of the two adjacent cells. However, a finite difference
between two values of an attribute, distributed on a finite
difference between two values of the support attribute represents an
element of derived distribution (in this case, a first rank one).
Therefore, the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>C</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">-type
processes extended on the set of all the adjacent cell pairs of a
sensory organ provides a derived distribution of the information
fluxes efferent from that organ. Because the operands</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">involved in the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>C</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">-type
processes must have (and so they are) a simultaneous existence (as we
have mentioned in the previous comment), this means that the derived
(contrast) distributions have also a simultaneous existence on the
level of the entire organism.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Primarily, the
process </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>D</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
must perform a qualitative identification of the support attribute
type which is common to all the model distributions of the perceived
object. Unlike the attributes from objects&rsquo; model sets, which
are quite numerous, there are only three support attributes, the
so-called fundamental attributes: spatial position, frequency and
time. The spatial position is a support attribute for the material
objects, time for the processual objects (S</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SUB>x</SUB></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">)
and the frequency goes with the periodical processes. This is
applicable to the external IPS objects; the internal IPS objects
which we have seen that they are exclusively internal ISS, all of
them have a single type of support attribute - spatial position
(location into the internal memory).</FONT></P>

X.14.2: While the comment X.14.1 was focused on the visual perception
organ, now it is time to shortly present the acoustic perception
organ. A sensor</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">ial distribution provided by
this sensory organ at a specific moment is an image (a conform
representation) of the frequency distribution of the perceived agent
flux. Within this sensorial distribution, each cell of the Corti
organ receives an elementary sound flux, that is the intensity of the
sonic flux evenly distributed on the frequency domain which is
assigned to the cell </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">(</SPAN><IMG SRC="x14_html_m5de852ff.gif" NAME="Object817" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=24><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,

the cell index within the ordered set of cells which makes-up the
Corti organ). The internal reference frequency 
<IMG SRC="x14_html_m3dd94d37.gif" NAME="Object818" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">of this elementary domain is given by the
spatial position of the sensory cell in the cochlea. Since the
relative spatial position both of the cells from the Corti organ and
of their related axons into the acoustic nerve is preserved up to the
auditory cortex, a spatial representation (a primary spatial
distribution) of the frequency of the received sound, more precisely
of its spectrum, will be developed into the neurons placed in this
cortex area. The derived distributions coming from this primary
distribution shall be generated into the neurons from the auditory
area as well, by means of an evaluation on the contrast between the
sensorial signals of two neurons which are related to two adjacent
Corti cells. As for the temporal evolution of the auditory
sensations, their analysis and evaluation is made similarly with all
the other fluxes, the information perceived at contiguous moments
being stored in adjacent spatial locations of STM, consequently, for
each perceived frequency we shall finally have a distribution with
spatial support, which corresponds with a temporal support
distribution (the perceived and stored process). The fact that the
biosystems (which for the time being, may be considered as natural
MS) use a single type of support attribute &ndash; the spatial one -
is a major argument used by the objectual philosophy for upholding
the assertion that the space is the single fundamental </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>material
realizable </I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">support attribute (see the
annex X.13).</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
