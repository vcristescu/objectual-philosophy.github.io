about which we have discussed so far, reaching to the conclusion that
they are objects (obviously, abstract ones), because these are
invariant distributions on their support domains and besides they are
objects, they are also complex objects. According to their definition
relations </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">X.6.5, X.6.7 and X.6.10, it may
be noticed that a state S</SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">1</SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
is based (in its composition) on a relation between two states S</SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">0</SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,
a state S</SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">2</SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
consists of two states S</SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">1</SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
or three states S</SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">0</SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,
so on. All these components of a state are abstract objects, which at
the moment of assessment are considered as operands of an abstract
process (computing, information processing), performed by an IPS;
but, as we saw in the chapter 8, the operands of a specific abstract
process must all have a simultaneous existence, whereas the states
which they stand for, are no longer available at that specific moment
(but they were existent at the previous moments). Due to this reason,
all the information regarding the previous states which are perceived
by IPS must be stored, and the storage takes place into a basic
component of an IPS - its memory. In chapter 8, we have also read
(the memory&rsquo;s axiom) that only objects can be stored into a
memory (invariant and finite information amounts). This is the reason
why the systemic philosophy has chosen an objectual approach on the
cognition, approach which in some cases is far more different from
the currently existing approach, but which is based on the fact that
the cognition cannot be separated from the abstract processes
deployed into the human mind or into AIPS, and these processes cannot
be understood without an accurate and general model of IPS, model
which explains us what the information processing actually means.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">In order to allow
the reader to make a clear picture on the essence of the motion&rsquo;s
objectual approach, let us imagine that the process which we have
analyzed it is an extremely simple motion picture made-up only from
five shots, in which a point from the screen (the internal reference
T of the moving object) performs the motion from the position </SPAN>

Each shot is associated to a state S</SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">0</SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
of the point object (in any movie, a shot is a state of all the
objects which are caught on camera, all of them are motionless
because they were recorded (stored), the shot being related to
temporal interval </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>&epsilon;</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
as its support (which during the recording session corresponds to the
exposure time and during playing, is related to the lighting time of
that shot). There is a finite interval (several temporal DP) between
two shots, which is high enough so that at a certain speed of the
motion process, it will allow the occurrence of different detectable
positions of objects.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">This interval </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>&Delta;t
</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">is the temporal support of the even
process P</SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">1</SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
and its density (invariant on this interval) is the constant motion
speed (which is assumed to be constant only in this interval), that
is a state S</SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">1</SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">.
In case of a movie, this interval is used when the motion picture
moves forward with one frame (that is a motion process which
substitutes the motion of the filmed object). Because the human brain
works similarly (by means of sampling and storage too), it is very
easy for it to &ldquo;synthesize&rdquo;, to reconstitute the motion
from the frames (samples) which were played, just as if this motion
would  be continuous. Finally, the usual remarks:</SPAN></P>

	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The objectual
	approach which is specific to this paper, based on distributions,

	error which this time may be found in the mathematics field - the
	derivative existence in one singular point - same type of error
