<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">X.3.1.2 The
objectual analysis of the set {R}</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of the definitions assigned to the
&ldquo;set&rdquo; notion from mathematics are using the term
&ldquo;object&rdquo;, but without defining it, counting on the
definitions found in dictionaries. The object is even the basic
element of a set, and its rigorous definition cannot be made without
taking into account the basic &ldquo;mechanisms&rdquo; of the
information processing within the biotic IPS, whose role is (among
others) even to separate (distinguish) the objects with a
simultaneous existence one from another. Therefore, a generic
definition of the object may be provided only by understanding the
operation of the biotic IPS (that is the central nervous system, in
case of the humans) because it (the biotic IPS) is &ldquo;guilty&rdquo;
for the wide-scale utilization of the objects, in total disagreement
with the natural abiotic material systems, for which the external
world is made-up from a single object, placed along the direction of
the unique resultant of the same type fields (as it was mentioned in
chapter 8).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The detailed definition and
classification of the objects is made since back to chapter 3, but we
are momentarily interested in one of the basic properties of this
notion - <I>distinguishability</I> <I>-</I> which is the property of
an object to be differentiated from the other objects with a
simultaneous existence. This property is based on the existence of a
perceptible <I>difference </I>found by an IPS between the properties
of the aimed object (comparison reference) and the other surrounding
objects, the difference which in this paper is also named <I>contrast</I>,
which allows the separation (discrimination) of the reference object
against the rest of the objects from the set.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In case of a <I>set of numbers</I>,
each object (obviously, abstract) from this information structure (a
complex object), with the internal domain symbolically limited by a
pair of brackets <I>{}</I>, is characterized by two properties: a
<I>qualitative</I> one (the element&rsquo;s position into the set)
and a <I>quantitative</I> one (numerical value). For reaching the
distinguishable status, any of the set objects must have an unique
qualitative attribute. In case of the ordered sets, there is an
interrelation between the qualitative (position) and the quantitative
attribute (numerical value), otherwise speaking, a qualitative and a
quantitative difference shall also exist between two adjacent
(successive) objects of the set. This situation is altered in case of
the ordered but <U>continuous</U> sets of numbers; in such
circumstances, by means of an excessive abstraction (we might even
call it abusive), a logical contradiction (absurdity) is reached,
because at the limit point, in case of an infinity of objects whose
numerical values are ranging within a finite interval, the adjacent
objects become undistinguishable one from another (the difference
between the numerical values of two objects tends to zero). Due to
this reason, the present paper limits the abstraction degree to
acceptable values by introducing the <I>realizable</I> set 
<IMG SRC="x312_html_2c091500.gif" NAME="Object554" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=24>as
an ordered set of the <I>abstract realizable</I> numbers, in which
each element may be distinguished from the adjacent ones by means of
the minimum quantitative contrast 
<IMG SRC="x312_html_1ae169a5.gif" NAME="Object555" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=15>,
however much less it is, but always different from zero. Thus, the
set of real numbers, as it is defined by the mathematics rules, shall
be kept for the ones which would intend to operate with it, although,
according to the objectual philosophy, this set is considered as a
virtual object. This fact has few important consequences:</P>
