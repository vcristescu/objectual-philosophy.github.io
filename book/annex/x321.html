<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">X.3.2.1 The
objectual definition of distributions</H3>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">While the <I>continuum</I>
model was the obsession for the mathematicians and for the idealist
philosophers for centuries, the objectual philosophy sets a more
pragmatic approach, the discrete one, based on the concept of <I>object
</I>as a finite information entity, with which a realizable IPS is
able to operate with. This approach, which due to this reason is also
denominated as <I>objectual</I>, is based on the fundamental
properties of the objects class: <I>invariance</I> (as model),
<I>(de)composability</I> and mostly, their <I>distinguishability</I>.
These properties are also self-understood (but without being defined)
in the mathematics field, in case of some objects, such as the sets,
whose elements are referred to as &ldquo;objects&rdquo; of the set.
On the other hand, the classic (continuous) mathematic approach may
be understood due to two reasons:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Continuity of some basic amounts
	(such as the spatial position of a material object), closely related
	to the infinite divisibility of space and of the abiotic material
	systems, it is upheld by the present paper as well, but with the
	note that this aspect (of continuity) belongs to the <I>absolute
	reality</I> (referred to as <I>objective reality</I> according to
	other papers, that is a virtual abstract object) which is
	inaccessible to realizable IPS, because it contains an infinite
	information amount. Due to the finite information processing
	ability, the realizable IPS must focus oneself to only on a part of
	the absolute reality, therefore on a discontinuous approach of the
	continuous amounts.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The objectual approach on the
	knowledge may be made only as a result of the understanding which
	has been occurring over the last century, regarding the information
	processing processes, which can be applied only on the discrete
	objects (deliberate pleonasm). 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
objectual philosophy, the distributions are considered as ordered
sets of distinct <I>assignment relations</I>, between the elements of
other two sets: the ordered set of the independent variable&rsquo;s
values (set which represents the distribution <I>support</I>) and the
set of the dependent variable&rsquo;s values (which in this paper is
also named the <I>distributed attribute</I>). The three sets which
are made-up from distinct abstract objects (belonging to the
relations, support values and distributed values) are obviously
equipotent. This way of defining the distributions determines in its
turn some changes in the definition of the terms derived from the
differential calculus:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another definition of the term
	<I>continuity</I> (required for defining the continuous <I>functions</I>),
	namely that the continuity is regarded as an <U>invariance</U> (a
	continuous unchanged maintenance) of the <U>symbolical assignment
	relation</U> on the support domain (continuity domain). In the most
	general distribution case (such as the lists, tables, matrix etc.),
	the concrete assignment relations do not have a general symbolic
	representation any longer (an invariant function), but they are
	specific to each support element, and in this case, the
	distributions, unlike the algebraic functions, can be used.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Organization of the distributions
	as complex objects, decomposable up to the level of the elementary
	object, determine the occurrence of many distribution <I>types</I>
	depending on the structure of this elementary object:</P>
</UL>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Primary <I>distributions,</I>
	where the fundamental element is made-up from a singular value of
	the dependent variable, assigned by means of a concrete (local)
	relation to a support singular value. If the set of the concrete
	assignment relations of a primary distribution has a symbolic
	representation which does not depend on the concrete support value,
	then, this distribution replaces the classic continuous functions
	<U>even if there is a discrete support</U>.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Derived</I> distributions of a
	primary distribution, where the fundamental element is a finite
	variation (difference) of a specific rank (of the same dependent
	variable from the primary distribution), assigned through a relation
	to a variation belonging to the support variable. Just as it was
	above mentioned, if there is an unique symbolic relation for the set
	of actual assignment relations of the elements belonging to the
	derived distribution, that distribution replaces the derivative
	functions (of any rank) of the primary distribution (they are also
	valid for discrete supports).</P>
</OL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The introduction of the <I>density
	</I>term for the ratio between the finite variation of distributed
	amount and the support variation, density which is equivalent to the
	local derivative of a function, but <U>not in a single point</U> (a
	singular value) as it is defined in the classic differential
	calculus, but on a support interval <U>with the internal reference
	at a specific singular value</U>.</P>
