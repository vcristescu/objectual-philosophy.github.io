<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always; margin-bottom: 0in;">Annex X.19 &ndash;
OBJECTUAL AND PROCESSUAL CAUSALITY</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The operation with the two basic
concepts of the objectual philosophy - <I>objects</I> and<I>
processes </I>- makes that the meaning of some terms which are
commonly used within the current scientific papers to be a different
one, depending on the association with the one or other of these
notions. This is also the case of the term known as <I>causality</I>.
These are few excerpts from The Dictionary of Logics<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>1</SUP></A>10:
&ldquo;<B>Causality </B>(causal connection) - relation between
phenomena (events) characterized by the fact that a phenomenon (named
<I>cause</I>) generates another phenomenon (named <I>effect</I>). For
example, we may consider the physical law of the materials <I>dilatation</I>
by means of <I>heating</I>. The heating is the cause of dilatation,
and the dilatation is the effect of heating. The causality relation
shall be displayed as follows: <SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>C(x,y)</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
(&ldquo;</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>x </I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">is
the cause of</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I> </I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>y</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">&rdquo;).
A much debated issue in the causality theory is the ratio between the
cause and effect </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>throughout time</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">.
Is it the cause </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>simultaneous</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
with the effect or is there a temporal </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>succession</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
between the cause and effect? One may notice that the
cause-phenomenon comes along with a series of circumstances. This set
of circumstances which contains the cause shall be called </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>complex
cause</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">. Let us consider </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>C(c)</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
as the complex cause. There are numerous complexes which are related
to a specific cause: </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>C</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>1</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>(c),
C</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>2</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>(c),
&hellip;, C</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>n</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>(c),
&hellip;</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> Regardless of other reasons,
it may be found that: </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><B>a</B></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">)
the cause phenomenon occurs (is recorded) experimentally, before the
occurrence of the effect phenomenon; </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><B>b</B></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">)
the effect phenomenon occurs only after the generation of the cause
phenomenon; </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><B>c</B></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">)
at least some of the features belonging to the cause phenomenon may
be produced apart from the effect phenomenon&hellip;&rdquo; (quote
ending).</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">If we shall
interpret the terms of the above mentioned definition in terms of the
objectual philosophy, the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>phenomenon
</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">notion is mainly referring to
processes, more exactly to an agent process - </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>the
cause</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">- which
acts on an object, produces another process, an action, a state
variation of the driven object - that is the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>effect.</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
In this case, it is clear that we are dealing with a causality
relation between the two processes, namely a relation of </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I><B>processual
causality</B></I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">. But, both the cause and
the effect processes are some variation state of specific objects:
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>the agent</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
and </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>the driven object</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">.
The states of the two objects, which are also objects (obviously,
abstract ones) are also maintained in a causality relation, because
the state of the driven object is an effect of the action, and the
state of the agent object is an effect of the reaction (if the
reaction exists). The states of some objects which deployed or still
deploy processual causality relations between their properties become
objects which are under </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I><B>objectual
causality</B></I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">If we are taking
into account the axiom I (axiom of the quantitative value), which
postulates that any existential attribute is the result of a
generating process (and vice-versa, any vanishing of the value of an
existential attribute is the result of an</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
annihilation process) we have the possibility of showing-up the
causal bonds, because the collection of the existential attributes of
an object or process (collection which makes-up the state of the
object or process) is the result of a set of generating processes.
This collection of generating processes makes-up a </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>causal
structure</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> for the state at the present
moment, state which is the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>effect </I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">of
the causal structure.</SPAN></P>

X.19.1: The term of &ldquo;causal structure&rdquo; which is used in
this context is the equivalent of the &ldquo;complex cause&rdquo;
term from the above-mentioned causality definition. The word
&ldquo;structure&rdquo; was used because, in a graphical
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">representation (for example, the flow chart
on the production of a specific object), there is an invariant
spatial distribution of the various stages (state-type objects) of
the processes with invariant bonds deployed between them, therefore
an S-type system.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Both the</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>chains</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> of
successive processes and the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>branches</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
with simultaneous processes belong to this structure, all these
having a specific contribution to the effect state. There is always a
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>causa proxima</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>
</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">the process which occurs right before
the effect, this cause being analyzed by many philosophers</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym" SDFIXED><SUP>1</SUP></A>11</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">.
It is worth noticing that in a causal chain, the absence of any
process from this chain leads to the absence of the final effect (the
objects and processes are conjointly associated, that is the
equivalent of the function &ldquo;AND&rdquo; from the mathematical
logics).</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">The introduction
within the objectual philosophy of the unusual concepts of </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>objectual
</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">and </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>processual
causality</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> allows a correct
understanding on the occurrence of some real or abstract objects from
our surroundings and their categorization into the appropriate
classes. For example, the children and the parents within a family
are involved in a relation of objectual causality, because the
children are a result (effect) of the previous reproduction, nursing
and education processes performed by their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Another example
which is also taken from the biosystems field is represented by the
hierarchical organisation of the individuals which belong to a group
forced by circumstances to act together (packs, school groups, teams
of professionals etc.). Within such a group, as a result of the
numerous bilateral interaction processes deployed between its members
(physical or intellectual confrontations, mutual evaluation of the
activity results etc.) which occur in a long enough time interval, a
&ldquo;scale of values&rdquo; is generated, in which each individual
has its place</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">, depending on the attribute
quantity under evaluation which belongs to each one of them. Every
bilateral interaction process settles a winner and a loser (another
two objects which are in a relation of objectual causality). The
member of the group which wins all the confrontations with the other
members shall become an alpha member, and the one which loses all,
shall be the omega member. The others shall be placed in intermediate
positions within this hierarchy. This kind of attributes evaluation,
by means of bilateral interactions, leads to an internal, relative
evaluation of the property difference between the members of the same
group (by resulting the internal distribution of the attribute
differences on each group member), without the possibility of
mentioning the absolute value of the property associated to each
member. If an external evaluation is required, specific interactions
between groups are needed or the attribute evaluation against an
external reference considered to be absolute (impartial evaluator) is
also required.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">All
these hierarchical structures are abstract objects which are the
result of a causal structure (a long series of simultaneous and/or
successive processes) which produce the occurrence (generation) of a
value order of the objects involved in the interactive processes from
the causal structure.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Comment
X.19.2: As we have previously mentioned, the objectual causality
relations are mostly visible in the social media. Within these media,
some attribute differences may be found between two individuals
(fame, fortune, education level, </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">look,
intelligence etc.), differences which are exclusively due to some
previous processes (therefore, to a processual causality). As a
result of these differentiated previous processes, a &ldquo;sedimentation&rdquo;
of the society&rsquo;s individuals in the so-called &ldquo;layers&rdquo;
or social &ldquo;classes&rdquo; takes place, which are nothing but a
set of individuals with a quasi-even distribution of a specific
property, and these individuals are involved in the same type of
causal relations against another set (other layer), to which the same
property, also quasi-evenly distributed, is very different in terms
of quantity.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">The </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">various
organization levels of the material systems are also involved in
objectual causality relations, because the systems with a high
organization level are a result (effect) of a formation (synthesis)
process of the system, from the systems with an inferior structure
(subject which was also approached in chapter 1).</SPAN></P>
