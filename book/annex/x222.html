<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">X.22.2 Specific
approach of the objectual philosophy on the interactions deployed by
means of potential energy fields</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Besides many other opinions which are
different from the ones sustained by the current physics, the
objectual philosophy presents totally different point of views
concerning two aspects of the <I>potential energy </I>notion:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What is the object which owns
	(which stores) the potential energy?</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What is the agent object in case
	of the energetic interactions deployed through potential energy
	fields with uneven distributions?</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There is a clear answer to the question
<B>1</B>, given by the objectual philosophy: by means of the
definition 7.6.2.3, the potential energy is distributed (stored) into
an EF with a null external coherent component, whose material support
is a medium which is under an overall rest state against an external
reference RS<SUB>e</SUB>. The volume density of the potential energy
is the <I>scalarized</I> FDV of the stochastic EF. As for the baric
potential energy, this scalarized density is the <I>pressure</I>, and
the Euler distribution of the pressure gradient into the support
medium represents a <I>potential energy field</I> (evidently, a
vectorial field).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First of all, we shall take into
account the case of an even distribution of the energy density in a
specific volume, such as, for instance, the pressure, and in this
case the pressure gradient is null. In this case, an evenly
distributed force shall be exerted against a MS &ldquo;immersed&rdquo;
into this kind of medium (the medium&rsquo;s action against MS), that
is a force to which MS shall reply in the same way, the reaction
force of MS against the medium, which is also evenly distributed on
the same RBS. Since the two forces (energy fluxes, according to the
definition 7.6.6.4.1) are evenly distributed on the surface, their
resultant shall be null, therefore, the body, together with its
equilibrium surface shall be motionless both against the medium and
also against the external reference system RS<SUB>e</SUB>. If the
distribution of the stochastic EF is radially uneven and the internal
reference of this distribution is RS<SUB>s</SUB> (considered as
motionless against RS<SUB>e</SUB>), this SR<SUB>s</SUB> shall be the
internal reference of an object called the <I>uneven radial </I><I>field
source</I>. Into a field like this, on the RBS of a MS &ldquo;immersed&rdquo;
inside it, the resultant of the surface distribution of the
stochastic EF quanta variation shall not be null any longer, but it
will have the direction in opposition with the field gradient, and
the resultant modulus shall be in direct proportion with the
proximity of the field source. Since there is a non-zero resultant
force (a coherent component of EF distributed on RBS), if the
&ldquo;immersed&rdquo; MS is free, it will be accelerated (it will
receive energy from the stochastic energetic field) on the direction
of the resultant force, that is the opposite gradient&rsquo;s
direction.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the current physics
textbooks, in a situation like this, it is said that a MS which may
be found in a field at a specific position 
<IMG SRC="x222_html_714ee7b0.gif" NAME="Object971" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=16>
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">against the field source, &ldquo;has the potential
energy </SPAN>
<IMG SRC="x222_html_628daa28.gif" NAME="Object972" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=44 HEIGHT=25><SPAN LANG="en-GB">&rdquo;,
which can be transformed into kinetic energy. The objectual
philosophy states that </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>it is not the MS
from the energy field which owns the potential energy, but the
environment, the material support of the stochastic energy field.</U></SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">The answer given by
the objectual philosophy to the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">question </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><B>2</B></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
is once again both clear and unexpected namely, the agent object, </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>the
agent EF source</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> (according to the
definition 7.3.3) which moves the &ldquo;immersed&rdquo; body </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>is
the medium on whose elements the potential energy is distributed</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,
and not the MS which represents the source (cause) of the field
unevenness. Between the source MS and the uneven field from the
support medium of the potential energy, there is a relation of
causality (a causal chain, see the annex X.19), because if no source
MS would exist, the uneven field would not exist either. However,
between the source MS and &ldquo;the immersed&rdquo; MS, there is no
direct energy flux deployed in its field, therefore, there is no
direct action either.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">If there are two MS,
which are both source of the same type of energy field, &ldquo;immersed&rdquo;
in the same medium, then, in each point of the space occupied by the
environment, there will be two gradient vectors which will have a
vector composition, by resulting a</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">nother
field, &ldquo;deformed&rdquo; against the configuration of the
initial fields. If we presume that the gradient direction of both
sources is the same, for instance from the source to the outside, as
a result of the composition of both fields, the gradient vectors will
be subtracted in the space between sources, resulting a more reduced
gradient, whereas in the rest of the space, the gradient vectors will
be added. Consequently, through the integration on RBS of FE density
of the two MS, two forces will be generated with the direction
against the local gradient (resultant), the so-called attraction or
repulsion forces, although </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>not the field
sources are the direct source of EF which determine the forces
generation</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">, but the environment is the
one which will &ldquo;push&rdquo; the two MS. But the uneven
distribution of the potential energy from the support medium would
not be able to exist without the existence of the field sources.</SPAN></P>

X.22.2.1: According to the issues mentioned in annex X.19, the force
which occurs on the RBS of an &ldquo;immersed&rdquo; MS into a medium
with a non-even distribution of the potential energy density is the
result of a causal chain, the medium&rsquo;s action against the body
is the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>proximate cause</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
of the force occurrence. However, the non-zero resultant of the
medium&rsquo;s action (resultant force) could not occur if there was
no uneven distribution of the pressure gradient, distribution whose
cause is the field source. In other words, the MS which represents
the source of the uneven field is the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>primordial

is the variation of the kinetic energy of MS (kinetic energy received
by MS from the medium) between the two spatial positions, an energy
equal with the variation of the potential energy of the medium
between those positions. EF which is generated by the external medium
which acts on MS, correspond to the force exerted by that medium
(medium&rsquo;s action against MS), and EF of the moving MS
corresponds to the force with which MS acts on the medium (reaction).
If MS is free, the force exerted by the medium becomes an active
force, and its mechanical work will be converted into the kinetic
energy of MS.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="direct_act"></A>In chapter 7,
section 7.3.3, where the action was described, the agent object was
the source of the agent flux. In this case, we may say that we are
dealing with a <I><B>direct action</B></I> between two objects -
agent object and driven object. In case of a MS &ldquo;immersed&rdquo;
into a medium with uneven energy distribution, the agent object (the
agent EF source) is the environment, and the driven object is any MS

MS of the uneven distribution.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>indirect</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
action which were previously mentioned regarding the energetic
actions may be easier understood by the reader by invoking once again
the case of the informational actions deployed in the humans
community. If the population of a country is assimilated with the
stochastic medium in which the information fluxes run randomly
between the individuals which interact through direct communication,
written messages or other types of information fluxes (IF), we may
say that this medium has a finite information amount (a stockpile)
stored inside it. Each element of the society owns a part of this
stock. A transfer (an IF) is possible to be performed from this
individual stockpile, by means of the common language (transfer which
was mentioned in chapter 9), to another member of the society. In
this case, the IF source is the agent object, IF is the agent flux,
and the flux receiver is the object which is informationally driven.
This is a classic example of informational action, process in which
IF runs directly from the source to the addressee, that is a reason
why we are dealing with a </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>direct</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
informational action. If the central system (political power) wants
to communicate a specific information to the population (such as a
governmental decision), this information shall be broadcast through
mass-media, that is a process similar with the propagation or
diffusion. In this case, the IF which reaches to a certain member of
the society (agent flux) is not coming directly from the main source,
but through a series of agents. It is clear that we are dealing with
a process of </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>indirect </I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">informational
action. It is worth noticing that in a DS, either it is a social
medium, NM or PFM, the actions which are based on propagation or
diffusion fluxes as their agent object, are indirect actions, with
the propagation/diffusion medium as an intermediate agent.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>
