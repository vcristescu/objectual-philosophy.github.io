<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">X.24.9.1
Temperature&rsquo;s objectual definition</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the definition X.24.6.1,
the heat contained into an atomic or molecular medium (NM) has a
finite set of thermal photons as its support, and they are kept
(partly confined) into the interstitial volume of that medium. Based
on the facts presented so far in this annex, these photons are
material objects with a finite energy stockpile depending only on the
photons frequency, stockpile which is distributed into a finite
volume with a constant cross section on the propagation direction.
The energy distribution of the heat&rsquo;s support photonic medium
is uneven and specific - Plank distribution. As we saw in the
chapters focused on distributions and objects, a set of objects from
the same class (in this case, photons) have a common model (the class
model) and specific attributes (for the objects differentiation).
These specific attributes are determined against an unique reference
value for the entire set of objects with a simultaneous existence.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the thermal photons, we have
noticed that the frequency is the distinctive attribute, but it is
also likely that the volume occupied at a given moment by a singular
photon to be distinct as well (the space-temporal exclusion to be
valid). For the time being, we are only interested in the frequency
attribute because it is the decisive attribute of the photons energy,
and a similar type of reference (a frequency as well) is required for
its evaluation. If the absolute artificial references (with zero
value) are mostly used in the scientific papers, as regards the
material natural systems, there are references which are auto-set as
a result of a very large number of interactions deployed between the
elements of the material system. In the previous section, we saw that
there is a natural reference applicable even for the energy attribute
contained by a thermal photon, reference which is associated to the
peak value of Plank distribution, that is an energy which according
to the relation X.13.8.1.8 is related to the following frequency:</P>

X.24.9.1.1: This way of defining the temperature is consistent with
one of the basic properties of this attribute, namely the fact that,
the temperature, as well as the frequency, do not have additive
features. As it is known, neither the temperature nor the frequency
can be added, but they can be compared (by means of subtraction) and
the difference between them can be also determined. As for the
absolute temperature, any value of the temperature is a simple
multiplication factor of the frequency which is associated with a
Kelvin, value which is given by the constant </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>C</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>T</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-US">.
