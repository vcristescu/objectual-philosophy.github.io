<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">X.3.9 Sets</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unlike the generic term of <I>set</I>
used in mathematics, which allows the existence of a set with a
single element, or even with zero elements (void set), the objectual
philosophy does not admit such virtual constructions in case of the
set of objects, because in this instance, the singular object and the
set of objects cannot be mistaken. For avoiding the confusions and
for maintaining the relation with the existing mathematic language,
the term of <I>systemic set</I> has been introduced, that is a term
which is defined as a set with 
<IMG SRC="x39_html_2b84c3d8.gif" NAME="Object679" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=19>elements.
When we are referring to <I>set</I> across this paper, it should be
always understood that we are dealing with a systemic set.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other hand, the sets are complex
objects under the meaning of the present paper, and just like any
other object, they are confined (contained) in an abstract container
(see the annex X.4), which stands for (represents) the object&rsquo;s
internal domain which is included within its boundaries. Because a
set is a complex object, such reserved domains must exist for all the
elements of the set (delimited by the elements boundaries) as well as
the total reserved domain of the set as a whole, domain which
represents the sum (union) of the elementary domains. According to
the common mathematic language, a set <FONT FACE="Symbol, serif"><I>&#61563;</I></FONT><I>X</I><FONT FACE="Symbol, serif"><I>&#61565;</I></FONT>
may be represented as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">	<IMG SRC="x39_html_m533d7f90.gif" NAME="Object680" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=24>	(X.3.9.1)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this example, the global domain has
its boundaries represented by brackets <I>{}</I> and the boundaries
of the elementary domains are represented by means of comma. As for
the internal domain of an object, either it is real or abstract, the
objectual philosophy issues the term of <I>container</I>, which is
minutely presented in the annex X.4. The correspondent of the <I>set</I>
term from mathematics is the set of the abstract containers existent
within the global boundaries.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These containers may be occupied or
not. If a container is empty, we shall say that it is <I>void</I>,
and if all the containers from the internal domain of a set are void,
we shall have a <I>void set</I>. This objectual approach is valid for
any type of existing mathematic object, either it is a number,
matrix, tensor, geometrical object, image point, body etc. all of
these having an internal domain associated with an abstract
container, and that container must be contained into a syntactic
value, that is either an internal ISS, or an external one, found
outside the IPS which operates with it. The ones who are familiar
with a programming language know very well that for each object from
the structure of a program, a storage space must be previously
assigned, in which that particular object will be stored. This
reserved memory space is even the container for that object, the real
container of the object&rsquo;s syntactic component.</P>
