<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there are two MS which own (where it
is stored) the potential energy, and these MS are interacting one
another (the two MS have a common RBS), a permanent energy exchange
(through energetic fluxes) shall be generated between the two MS.
This bilateral exchange process has the equilibrium state between two
potential energy stockpiles as its final processual state, that is a
state in which the energy flux (EF) density between the two MS are
equal and consequently, the re-circulated EF between the systems are
equal and in counter direction (the equilibrium surface of the two EF
is motionless against an external reference).</P>

compressed air or into a resort are specific cases of potential
energy stored in some MS. By considering a cylinder equipped with a

X.22.1.2: The major difference between the current physics and the
objectual philosophy </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">regarding the approach
of this equilibrium state consists in the fact that the physics
sustain that there is no energy exchange between the two systems
during the equilibrium state, whereas the objectual philosophy
asserts that on the contrary, there is an EF on both sides
(therefore, a permanent energy exchange), but these fluxes are equal
and oppositely directed. According to this approach, the EF source,
both as an agent and a reaction, is an energy stockpile; if this
stockpile is finite, it can be depleted at a certain intensity
(power), and once with this depletion, the force (active or reactive)
and the equilibrium state shall vanish as well. The permanent energy
exchange between the two systems makes that the two energy stockpiles
to remain constant (if the external escapes are null). Based on the
issues mentioned into the annex X.10, as regards the equilibrium, an
equitable energy transaction occurs between the two interactive
systems.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">relation applicable for this simplified
case, in which there are only two material systems which own the
potential energy, and these are under interaction. In relation
X.22.1.1, we may see that the amount <I>k</I> is a second rank
energetical capacitance for the potential energy stored into the arc,
the energy state attribute being the deformation

The energy stockpile surplus

surface, by the force <I>F</I><SUB><I>p</I></SUB> which becomes
active until the moment of equilibrium restore.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the support media are homogeneous,
the potential energy stockpile which may be found in both systems is
evenly distributed, both in the gaseous medium and in the arc&rsquo;s
material, in case of a cylindrical spiral resort, as a transversal
strain on the section of the spiral-shaped rod. If we replace the
gaseous medium with a rod made-up from a solid material (see the
figure X.22.1.1.c), the potential energy of the compressed arc shall
be balanced by the potential energy within the rod&rsquo;s solid
medium, but because the solids compressibility is much more reduced
than the gases compressibility, the deformation 
<IMG SRC="x221_html_m28267b2e.gif" NAME="Object970" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=19>
of its length is undetectable by the human eye. But, even in the
solids&rsquo; case, there is also a deformation of the medium which
is in proportion with the level of the potential energy stored in
that medium (see the annex X.21).</P>
