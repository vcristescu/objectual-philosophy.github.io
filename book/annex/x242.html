Transitions between two energetic orbitals belonging to the same EP</H2>

is a state variation </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>process</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
of that particular EP which is placed on one of the structural
orbitals (SO). We saw that an EP which lies on such a structural
orbital, depending on the intensity of the external EF may have more
energy levels which are associated with many EO. In case of the
absence of the external fluxes (isolated system), the EP&rsquo;s
energy which occupies a SO has the lowest level, being related to a
fundamental EO. The condition which is required for the energy
received by EP from the external EF is that the energy to be less
than the EF which re-circulates between the couple&rsquo;s particles
(bonding energy), otherwise, the driven EP shall be expelled from the
system. The variation process of the state of an EP placed on SO,
means a temporary desynchronisation process of a couple of EP placed
on such orbitals, desynchronisation generated by the absorption of an
external EF </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>by one</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
of the EP involved into the couple (usually, the external one). As
long as the frequency rates of the space-temporal modulation of the
EP participating to a couple are identical and synphasic, the
electric fluxes (whose existential attribute is the electric charge)
released by the two particles are entirely re-circulated between the
two EP (there are no electric fluxes released outside the volume
occupied by the two EP</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym" SDFIXED><SUP>1</SUP></A>24</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">).
At the moment of receiving an EF from the outside, the receiver
particle of that flux shall be desynchronized with its pair, and this
desynchronization will last a while (at least as long as the
disturbing flux is maintained).</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">The
reaction of the EP ensemble at the incidence of an external EF is the
same as the reaction of any MS: the incident flux shall be oppose</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">d
to the reaction flux, until one of the fluxes (either the incident or
the reaction one) would have been depleted its resources. If the
energy provided by the external EF is higher than the EF
re-circulated between the two EP (bonding energy), the couple shall
be broken (the expulsion of the driven EP from system takes place),
according to the law IV of MS formation (see section 7.8). If this
energy is less-valued, EP which receives the flux shall be
temporarily converted into an EO with a higher energy, excited
orbital, (absorption-storage phase of the incident flux) until the
incident EF would be finished, and then the reverse process of
re-sending the energy surplus (EF temporarily stored) shall come
next, towards outside (reflection), with the returning on the
fundamental EO.</SPAN></P>
