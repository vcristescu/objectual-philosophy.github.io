	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Through its
	models, objects and specific fundamental processes, the objectual
	philosophy upholds the Newton model of the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>corpuscular
	photon</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> and moreover, of the photons as
	material systems which deploy a weak interaction between them.
	Obviously, a coherent explanation is also required for the &ldquo;wave&rdquo;
	aspect of the photonic behaviour, but this explanation</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>1</SUP></A>41</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
	is in this case similar for all the types of MS (electrons, protons,
	neutrons, photons etc.) which are all characterized by the
	interference and diffraction phenomena Consequently, according to
	the objectual philosophy, the long-debated corpuscle/wave dualism
	from the official physics does not exist any longer.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Due to the
	specific principles and axioms, the objectual philosophy does not
	uphold the purely probabilistic model (of the probability waves),
	promoted by</SPAN><SPAN LANG="it-IT"> Schrödinger model, but it
	states a determinisim and a very close inter-correlation between the
	fluxes generated by the particles from the atom&rsquo;s structure,
	interrelation which is mandatory for developing a constructive
	interaction.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="it-IT">The
	orbitals-based </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">structure of the
	bi-particle systems (made-up from EP with complementary charges) and
	of the systems made-up from this kind of elements (atomic kernels,
	atoms, molecules etc.) makes that an external energy flux which is
	incident on one of the constitutive EP, to be able to disturb the
	synchronism characteristic to the fundamental state, state in which
	that particular MS is electrically neuter in the external space. As
	a result of the action exerted by the external flux, an absorption
	transition (temporary storage) takes place, followed by an emission
	transition (returning, reflection), processes through which, the
	couple of excited EP emits a photon with surplus energy and it
	returns to the fundamental state.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disturbing
	incident flux of the fundamental state&rsquo;s synchronism can be
	any type of energy flux (photon, impulse of an EP or moving atom
	etc.) but the flux which is reflected (re-emitted) shall be always
	made-up from a photon (for each couple of excited EP), and from a
	kinetic flux (overall motion) of the EP system.</P>

	the intensity variation of the direct interaction between the neuter
	atoms (collision, vibration, compression etc.) leads also to the
	photons emission is the main cause of the thermal phenomena deployed
	within NM. The continuous (but uneven) distribution of the

	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fact that the

	is extremely low, allows them to propagate through the interstitial

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">The multiple
	absorption processes, temporary storage, re-emission, to which all
	the thermal photons are subjected during the interactions with the
