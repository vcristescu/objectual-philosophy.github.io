<H2 CLASS="western">X.24.1 Orbitals of EP</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the current knowledge
regarding the atoms&rsquo; internal structure, but by using the
notions which are specific to this paper, we may identify
<I>distributions, objects, processes</I> and internal <I>fluxes</I>
belonging to these types of MS. The purpose of this annex is not to
make a review on the nuclear internal structure, what really matters
to us is just the assertion upheld by this paper, that the atomic
nucleus (for a certain type of atom) has an invariant spatial
structure, with an internal RS, structure which also determines the
invariant configuration as well (for the same atom type) of the
spatial distribution of the electron&rsquo;s orbitals which make-up
the external (peripheral) DS<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>1</SUP></A>15
of the atom. As a result of this nuclear structural stiffness, the
atomic peripheral DS, which is made-up from electrons only, has also
a rigid structure<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym" SDFIXED><SUP>1</SUP></A>16,
which means that it is a S-type DS (more exactly, S<SUB>R</SUB>-type,
in which the constitutive elements are maintained despite the alleged
repulsion between them, by the powerful electrical interaction
deployed with the central subsystem - the nucleus with its positive
charges).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main argument for the existence of
the structural stiffness of the orbitals where the atomic electrons
are found is even the stiffness of S-type media made-up from atoms or
molecules, stiffness which could not exist if the covalent or ionic
bonds (interactions) deployed between atoms would not have stable
preferential directions and invariant spatial positions against the
atomic internal RS. Within the peripheral electronic DS, the motion
of each electron has unique and invariant state attributes (whose
existential attributes make-up, among others, the so-called set of
quantic numbers), although each of these electrons performs multiple
motions (therefore, they are fluxes).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This means that the quantic numbers
which defines the state of a specific electron are quantitative
(existential) attributes of some invariant processual qualitative
attributes, namely, they are parameters of some invariant fluxes.
Since we are talking about fluxes, which are objects set in motion,
it is clear that the position of the moving electron is
non-determined, but in exchange, some invariant attributes for the
velocity or the acceleration of the object can be defined (with its
equivalent, that is the energy or the orbital frequency), for the
spatial distribution of the flux line (plane, radius, orbital axis,
position of the axis and of the orbital plane against the atomic RS,
which coincides with the nuclear one), distance of the orbital plane
against the nucleus (which is invariant for a certain electronic
layer), etc. Consequently, if we cannot define the position of an
electron, we can however define the position of the <I>orbital </I>on
which it is placed.</P>

X.24.1.1: This definition marks another net distinction between the
objectual philosophy and the current physics which states that the
motion of the constitutive elements of an atom has a purely
probabilistic character (being defined by Schr</SPAN><FONT FACE="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">o</SPAN></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-US">dinger

current physics, but here, this abstract object defines a spatial
domain in which a probability wave is being framed. As we have seen
in chapter 7 and as we are going to see further, the objectual
philosophy states that a constructive interaction between two
components of a MS can exist if only there is a </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><U>close

bond energy values, but which are similar in terms of model. Since we
are talking about dynamic material systems (a static equilibrium

this MS (positions which are non-determined but they are placed in
the volume occupied by the orbital), as well as to the orbitals where
they are located, the set of the existential attributes of these

this MS. The space-temporal exclusion of the orbital moving EP, is
determined also by the fact that such movement generates a RBS with a
non-permanent distribution of the permeability (see section 7.2.6),
but this RBS behaves in some circumstances (for certain fluxes) as a
material object.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">If we
shall take into account the classification of the internal fluxes of
MS mentioned in chapter 7, it may be noticed that the EP orbitals

	which are different mostly due to the energy surplus of the

	energy which occupies a specific EO and its bonding energy shared
	with its partner is inverse proportional, so that, if the energy
	surplus of EP reaches a certain level, the re-circulated flux is
	cancelled and EP leaves the system (see section 7.8, law IV).</SPAN></P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">It is worth
mentioning that each SO is related to a series (a set) of EO, with
the energy of each one depending on the intensity of the external
energy fluxes which acts on that atom and on the quantity of energy

orbital.</P>

fluxes which may be found anyway into the emerging fields from each

at least a partly compensation of the energy losses of the MS

period, or at an integer number of periods. In the first case, we may
say that there is a compensation made on the fundamental frequency,
