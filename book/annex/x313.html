Conclusions</H3>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The abstract objects which belong
	to a certain class have all the same model; since the integers, as
	well as the rational and irrational numbers belong to the class of
	the real numbers, this means that all these categories (subsets of
	{R} are also made-up from AAV, an infinity of digits is therefore
	required for the representation of an actual value. In this respect,
	the proof is that both the irrational and the transcendental numbers
	have an infinite number (officially acknowledged) of decimals, the
	continuity of the real numbers axis requiring that the other members
	(singular values) to also own the same infinite number of decimals
	for their representation. An accurate representation of the integers
	such as AAV would mean (for instance, according to the decimal
	syntax), an integer followed by an infinity of zero digits after the
	decimal separator. The mutual convention of letting aside the series
	of zero digits into the current representations of the integers does
	not also mean the renunciation at the principle that any number
	belonging to{R}is identical in terms of model features with any
	other number belonging to this set, all of them being AAV. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The necessity of an infinity of
	digits for a complete representation of an AAV makes that such
	numbers to not be realizable neither under a material nor an
	abstract form (because it would require an ISS with infinite sizes),
	these numbers are therefore <I>virtual</I>, unable to exist as
	concrete values (class instances). Thus, it is worth mentioning that
	<U>despite of its denomination as set of the real numbers, this set
	is exclusively made-up from virtual numbers</U>.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The realizability of a numerical
	value is strictly related to the necessity that this value to
	contain a finite quantitative information amount; consequently, any
	value which is materially or abstract realizable must have a non
	determination interval. Obviously, this interval is gradually
	decreased, as the technological and scientific progress is
	increasing, but it will never be null.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The virtual object named &ldquo;the
	set of the real numbers&rdquo;, from the official mathematics,
	represents an asymptotic model, a limit impossible to be reached for
	the realizable objects, but towards which all the numerical values
	tend to, as the progress in the scientific field keeps rise-up. It
	is an example of extreme idealization of a notion: the numerical
	value (existential attribute, scalar).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The objectual philosophy is
	structured on objects, with a permanent control on the types of
	objects used for modelling the human knowledge. It is natural that
	their associated objects and processes, meant to model the material
	systems, to belong to the class of materially realizable objects.
	The concrete abstract objects with which the real IPS are able to
	operate within the abstract processes, must belong to the class of
	abstract realizable objects, whose quantitative values must be
	finite, regardless of the IPS&rsquo;s performance degree. On the
	other hand, as we have seen in chapter 9, the <I>absolute reality</I>
	has attributes with infinite quantitative values, values which
	belong to the virtual (mathematic) set{R}. In other words, the
	continuous set {R}, just as the absolute reality, are virtual,
	asymptotic objects, towards which any kind of knowledge tends to,
	but at the same time, we must be aware that they are intangible in
	relation to any <U>realizable</U> knowledge.</P>
