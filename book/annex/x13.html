<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always; margin-bottom: 0in;">Annex X.13 &ndash;
ABSTRACT SUPPORT AND MATERIAL SUPPORT</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chapter 2 which is focused on
distributions also defines the <I>support </I>of a distribution as
the domain of values of the independent variable. This domain
consists of a set of singular values, which are either quantitative
(numerical, scalar) or literal (words, characters), or other type
(for instance, graphical symbols), otherwise speaking, we are dealing
with an abstract object. All the singular values contained by this
object - distribution&rsquo;s support - are evaluated by an IPS, if
those values exist in its internal or external memory. Even the
distributions are only some mathematic models of real objects, the
distribution&rsquo;s support being only a part of this model.
According to the objectual philosophy, the word <I>support</I> was
continually used for the values domain of an independent variable
belonging to a distribution only due to reasons related to a gradual
transition from the usual terms from mathematics to the terms
specific to this paper. It is clear that in this case, we are dealing
with an <I><B>abstract support</B></I>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In chapter 8, where the general IPS
model was presented, we have seen that each information perceived by
an IPS has a <I><B>material support</B></I> - a MS belonging to the
class of information support systems (ISS). When we are talking about
ISS, this means that each type  of transmissible qualitative
information perceived by an IPS is associated to a material flux with
specific properties, flux which is coming from (efferent) a source
material object. Besides the natural qualitative properties (given by
specialized sensory organs of each type of evolved organism), the
people are able to perceive properties of the transmitted objects
also through fluxes placed outside the natural perception range, by
means of flux converters which turn the fluxes which cannot be
directly perceived (IR (infrared), UV (ultraviolet), X, &gamma;
photons, electrons, neutrons fluxes etc.) into directly perceivable
fluxes (IR or UV <FONT COLOR="#000000">visors, electronic
microscopes, IR, UV, X, </FONT>&gamma; photons,<FONT COLOR="#000000">
telescopes etc.). Taking into account these findings, it is worth
noticing the fact that </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>absolutely all
these properties which are perceived either directly or indirectly</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
have as their  </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>material support</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
both the aimed object and the material fluxes which are generated by
it  (either the emergent fluxes or the reflected ones). Since one of
the most important properties of the objects perceived by an IPS is
the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>spatial position</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
(determined against an internal spatial RS, which can be found at any
organization</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I> </I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">level
of the biosystems), the objectual philosophy claims that:</FONT></P>

of a MS, with its domain of values - infinite space - cannot exist
without a material support. Since this property is considered to be
continuous and infinite divisible, this means that for each
infinitesimal space domain, a support MS must exist.</SPAN></I></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
axiom VIII together with SOP (systemic organization principle) which
was presented in chapter 1, both postulate the direct interrelation
between the infinity of the organization domain of the abiotic MS and
the space infinity. The space exists just because of the fact it is
the support domain of the material systems existence; any MS needs an
internal spatial domain (delimited by RBS) and an external spatial
domain delimited by the contests with the proximity neighbors (in
which the external energy of a MS is contained). Due to this reason,
it is impossible to exist any spatial domain, no matter how little it
is, without being fully charged with MS with different organization
levels. The systems with superior organization are nothing else but
finite and limited parts (partitions) belonging to this overcrowded
MS set which have an uneven energy distribution per element, sections
which can move/propagate through that set. The assumption of the
infinite size of the space therefore draws both the assumption of the
infinite divisibility of MS and the assumption of their infinite
composition ability. Moreover, if the space is the abstract support
domain of the material systems, the material systems are the space&rsquo;s
real support.</FONT></P>
