<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">X.2.2 The
distribution of states on the Earth surface</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As the distribution
name already suggests, we are dealing with a spatial distribution
with 3D support<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>8</SUP></A>4
(the area of the Earth&rsquo;s land, neglecting the territorial water
section due to simplicity reasons) of the attribute named <I>state
sovereignty</I>, attribute which consists of many other components
(such as the state name, national anthem, flag, official language,
government form, defense system, economic system, population,
international recognition, total area etc). This attribute may be
represented within the abstract objects syntax as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><I>{e</I><SUB><I>k
</I></SUB><I> S</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB><I>}</I> = <FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61563;&#61563;</FONT>name<FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61565;&#61655;&#61563;</FONT>national
anthem<FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61565;&#61655;&#61563;</FONT>flag<FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61565;&#61655;&#61563;</FONT>political
system<FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61565;&#61655;</FONT>&hellip;<FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61565;</FONT>
         (X.2.2.1)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">where <I>S</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB> is
the <U>qualitative</U> attribute <I>state sovereignty</I> of the
state <I>k</I>, and <I>e</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB><SUB> </SUB>is its
existential attribute (quantitative). As a result of international
conventions, the same juridical unit (value which according to the
international law regulations is equivalent to the states equality
from the political point of view) was assigned for <I>e</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB>,<SUB><I>,</I></SUB><SUB>
</SUB>but the qualitative attributes <I>S</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB>
shall never be identical (their role is even to separate,
differentiate the <I>states</I> objects one from another). The
attribute <I>S</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB> is evenly distributed on an
area which is referred to as <I>state territory</I> (internal spatial
domain of the state object), limited by a separation line from the
territory of the neighbor states: common border (boundary). Each
state has a capital (internal reference of the state&rsquo;s domain),
with known coordinates (spatial position on the Earth), against which
the positions of the internal objects of that state<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym" SDFIXED><SUP>8</SUP></A>5
are being assessed. Each state has also a political leadership (a
government), that is the internal reference of the social community
which populates that state.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">This distribution
(of the states sovereignty) taken as a whole is obviously non-even,
the super political powers being much &ldquo;more sovereign&rdquo;
than the weaker states.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
X.2.2.1: Although the states are <I>de jure</I> considered equal as
regards their sovereignty, this equality is <I>de facto</I> just as
real as the equality of people is; after all, the sovereignty of a
state is a global attribute, a result of the accumulation of all the
resources which are owned by that state, mostly of the political,
economic and military resources (these are the real support of
sovereignty).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Also, the size of
these states varies very much, ranging from couple of km<SUP>2</SUP>
to about 10<SUP>7</SUP> km<SUP>2</SUP>, depending on the resources
and greed of their leaders over the history. What is relevant for the
goal of this annex is that all of these are <I>elements</I> of the
distribution which is mentioned in the annex title, regardless of
their area and power. The element status shows that from the point of
view of the even distributed attribute - that is the state
sovereignty recognized by the other states - <U>and only from this
point of view</U>, the decomposability limit was reached.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
X.2.2.2: Most of the states have another internal distribution of the
territories with their own government (a sort of much more limited
sovereignty), with an individual reference (the regional centre), but
without direct access to the political and military foreign affairs
of the state as a whole. There is also an internal spatial
distribution for the other internal objects (localities,
agricultural, touristic or industrial areas, military bases etc.).
Otherwise speaking, from the point of view of other criteria, the
state system is still decomposable, but not as far as the state
sovereignty concerns.</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

	For instance, the distance covered within the road system of that
