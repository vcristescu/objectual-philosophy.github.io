<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">X.24.4 The
photonic perturbation of the bound EP states</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">In a previous
section we have mentioned that the reaction of the electrons&rsquo;
ensemble bound in an atomic MS (electrons which make-up its
peripheral medium), at the incidence of an external energy flux is
the same for any type of MS: the incident flux shall be opposed to
the reaction flux, until one of the fluxes (either the incident or
the reaction one) would have been depleted its resources. If the
energy provided by an external EF is higher than the EF re-circulated
between the two EP, the couple shall split (the expulsion of the EP
from the system shall be produced). If this energy is less, EP which
receive the flux shall be temporarily transferred on a EO with a
higher energy (absorption-storage stage of the incident EF), until
the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">exhaustion of the EF, and then, the
reverse process of resending the energy surplus (temporarily stored
EF) to the outside (reflection) shall come next, </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>also
as a photon</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> generated by the emission
transition of the driven electron.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">At this moment, the
reader is invited to be very attentive because we shall talk about a
process - that is the reflection of a photon on an atom (or on any
other atom set which makes-up the surface of an object) - from a
different perspective than the one specific to the current physics
textbooks. Based on the above-mentioned facts, it may result that at
the incidence of a photon on an atom (more exactly, on an electron
placed on a peripheral orbital), which means that the photon is an
incident EF, the first stage of absorption/storage of this EF</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
shall exist, storage into the energy of the driven electron which
passes on an excited orbital.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><B>Attention!</B></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
The photon&rsquo;s energy was entirely transferred to the electron
placed on the excited orbital, otherwise speaking, starting with this
moment, the incident photon </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>does no
longer exist</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">, but its energy does, even
if this energy is under another form (without the component T). The
process which </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>is equivalent</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
with the transformation of the coherent incident flux into a
stochastic or periodical flux, without the component T of the initial
photon</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>1</SUP></A>26</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,
took place. After the storage interval (which is shorter in case of
the instable excited orbital, or non-determined in terms of time in
case of a metastable orbital), the emission transition takes place,
that is a process in which the couple </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>excited
electron_proton partner</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> shall generate
to the outside a photon with the energy equal with the temporarily
stored one. But, once again, pay attention, the generated photon
(equivalent with the reflected EF) </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>is
not the same with the incident photon</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
but it is generated into the electronic medium of the atom which was
previously driven by the former incident photon.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">This fact explains
in a</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> natural and coherent manner why a
photonic flux reflected by the surface of a body carries with oneself
some data about the chemical composition of the body; this is
natural, because the reflected photons are generated by the atoms of
that particular body, while the incident photons are produced into
the source of the incident photonic flux.</SPAN></P>

	In case of the excited electron, the flux stored without the

	that is the electron&rsquo;s orbital motion deployed on the excited
	orbital.</SPAN></P>
