<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">In the beginning,
it must be clearly settled that the bio-systems also belong to the
class of the material systems, the abiotic material systems making-up
the abiotic support of all the bio-systems, regardless of their
complexity. Consequently, the model attributes of the abiotic MS
shall be present (inherited) at bio-systems as well, but there will
also be extra attributes which are specific only to the bio-systems
class. Similarly with the abiotic MS, there will also be a reference
medium (RM), the medium with an existence previous to any bio-system
and whose elements were the basis for the formation of the first and
the most simple biosystems. This medium must own some compulsory
qualities:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RM&rsquo;s elements must be the
	generating set for any system which will be comprised in the
	composition of all the bio-systems. Since the internal organization
	of the elements of known bio-systems starts from the atomic and
	molecular level, the media which are made-up from these elements are
	the natural media (NM, whose elements are those about 90 types of
	stable atoms which can be found in the peripheral media of the

This medium was also preserved as an internal medium in an amount of
over 70% at the advanced biosystems which currently exist, even if
most of them were diffused from the primordial medium into other
media (atmosphere, soil and the interstitions from the</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>

flux triad model - immergent, stored, emergent - which was observed
for the first time at bio-systems, but which is considered as an
universal model for MS in the paper herein, is obviously valid for
the bio-systems as well, but on another organization level against
the support abiotic systems.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Due
to its importance, we let at last the specification that, besides the
above-mentioned fluxes, there are also information fluxes included in
the fluxes which make-up that particular triad. The significance of
these fluxes is also underlined by the fact that the triad of the
information fluxes makes-up a special material system: information
processing system (IPS). This MS-type is specific to the biosystems
and only in the last century, its imitation has become possible by
means of the artificial IPS.</FONT></P>
