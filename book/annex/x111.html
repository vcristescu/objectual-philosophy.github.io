<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">In the beginning,
it must be clearly settled that the bio-systems also belong to the
class of the material systems, the abiotic material systems making-up
the abiotic support of all the bio-systems, regardless of their
complexity. Consequently, the model attributes of the abiotic MS
shall be present (inherited) at bio-systems as well, but there will
also be extra attributes which are specific only to the bio-systems
class. Similarly with the abiotic MS, there will also be a reference
medium (RM), the medium with an existence previous to any bio-system
and whose elements were the basis for the formation of the first and
the most simple biosystems. This medium must own some compulsory
qualities:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RM&rsquo;s elements must be the
	generating set for any system which will be comprised in the
	composition of all the bio-systems. Since the internal organization
	of the elements of known bio-systems starts from the atomic and
	molecular level, the media which are made-up from these elements are
	the natural media (NM, whose elements are those about 90 types of
	stable atoms which can be found in the peripheral media of the

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RM must allow the quasi-free

This medium was also preserved as an internal medium in an amount of

most of them were diffused from the primordial medium into other

flux triad model - immergent, stored, emergent - which was observed
for the first time at bio-systems, but which is considered as an

the bio-systems as well, but on another organization level against
the support abiotic systems.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Due
to its importance, we let at last the specification that, besides the
above-mentioned fluxes, there are also information fluxes included in
the fluxes which make-up that particular triad. The significance of
these fluxes is also underlined by the fact that the triad of the
information fluxes makes-up a special material system: information
processing system (IPS). This MS-type is specific to the biosystems
and only in the last century, its imitation has become possible by
means of the artificial IPS.</FONT></P>
