Dimensional point model</H3>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">We have seen in
chapter 3 that an object means a distribution of at least one
property on a support domain, an invariant distribution, evaluated
against an internal reference system. For making a differentiation
between two or more objects with a simultaneous existence, those
objects must be distinguished through at least one differential
attribute (see the conditions 3.1.a&hellip;d from the section 3.1).
We have also noticed that a realizable point means a truncated
numerical value (which in this paper is named a <I>normal value</I>),
and a virtual point is considered as an AAV. Since it is perceived
like an elementary object (a distribution element), the realizable
point has a finite interval (non determination, uncertainty, error
interval) as its support domain, on which its existential attribute
is evenly distributed, and the virtual point has a single AAV from
the set {R} with its existential attribute, namely a Dirac-type
virtual distribution, with a null no determination interval.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
X.3.6.1.1: Now, it is time for us to give an explanation to an
evident contradiction occurred as a result of introducing the term of
<I>realizable AAV</I>. This means that throughout this paper, we
shall put the accent on the dichotomy between the abstract realizable
and virtual objects and now, we are talking about realizable virtual
objects. Well, there is no contradiction, but only a special
truncation convention, which allows that the representation to be
done <U>only for certain numerical values</U>, of an endless series
of digits, by using several special syntax rules. In mathematics, it
is well-known the notation rule applied for the decimal numbers with
groups of digits which are identically repeated from a certain
position after the decimal separator (the so-called decimal periods).
For example, 1/3=0,(3), where the group of digits (which in this case
is made-up from a single digit) from the brackets is the period. This
notation means that the group placed in brackets is endlessly
repeated. Other examples: 1/6=0,1(6); 1/11=0,(09); 1/13=0,(076923)
and many others. This notation agreement shows a special case: when
the decimal period is exclusively made-up from zeros, there are no
notations any longer (for instance, 1,(0)=1; 1/4=0,25(0)=0,25 etc.).
The numerical values obtained as a result of this latter
representation convention shall be named <I>relative accurate values</I>
(RAV) because they depend on a truncation convention (of the zeros
series). Therefore, if we have an AAV which consists of a finite
number of digits followed by an infinite series of zero digits, the
renunciation to that infinite zero series makes the representation to
be realizable. But, <U>it is only a representation convention</U>,
which has to be taken into account - the value from {R} which
corresponds to that truncated value contains an infinity of digits
(of zeros). For example, this is how the things work in case of the
integers; if we would display them accurately as regards the
information, as fragments of the set {R} at unit intervals, after
their each numerical representation, the decimal separator should
follow and it must be followed by an infinite series of zeros. The
mutual agreement of representing only the digits which are different
from zero placed in front of the decimal separator remains however a
truncation form.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Let us return to
the point model from the figure X.3.6.1.1 according to the version of
the realizable point. In this case, we are also dealing with a known
singular value - the internal reference <I>x</I><SUB><I>Rk</I></SUB>
&ndash; which is associated to the non determination interval <FONT FACE="Symbol, serif"><I>&#61541;</I></FONT>,
but this time, the value <I>x</I><SUB><I>Rk</I></SUB> is a RAV (as we
have aforementioned, a special type of AAV which can be represented
through the renunciation to an infinite series of zero digits).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The internal
reference value of the realizable point may take various positions in
the internal domain 
<IMG SRC="x361_html_1ae169a5.gif" NAME="Object641" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=18>
, but three of them are the most notorious ones: the extreme left,
the extreme right and the central positions. The figure X.3.6.1.1
shows the version with the central reference, and in this case, the
domain 
<IMG SRC="x361_html_1ae169a5.gif" NAME="Object642" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=18>
is divided in two sub-domains which are equal on both sides of the
reference. The lower boundary of the domain shall be placed at 
<IMG SRC="x361_html_m4575ec1b.gif" NAME="Object643" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=57 HEIGHT=24>,
the upper one at 
<IMG SRC="x361_html_m32b22a68.gif" NAME="Object644" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=57 HEIGHT=24>,
and by using the notation for the open intervals from the
mathematics, this domain may be written as 
<IMG SRC="x361_html_m549566bd.gif" NAME="Object645" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=24>.
In case of the left or right references, we shall use the notation
for semi closed intervals which is very convenient in case of the
concatenation of the realizable points. By considering the version of
the extreme left reference, the support interval may be written as 
<IMG SRC="x361_html_m1c53a34.gif" NAME="Object646" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=24>,
and the extreme right version may be written as 
<IMG SRC="x361_html_m5e9d2d63.gif" NAME="Object647" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=24>.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">In case of the
<I>realizable point</I> object, as we have already mentioned in
chapter 2, the objectual philosophy states a special name, that is
