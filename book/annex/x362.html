	of the variable <I>x</I> is considered to be, informationally
	speaking, as non-decomposable, this means that inside it, <U>there
	are no known singular values</U> except the internal reference
	value. The non-existence of these internal values is equivalent with
	the <U>lack of information</U> or with the <U>existence of a non
	determination</U>. Therefore, the DP 1D elementary object is
	equivalent with a single AAV (internal reference), where a non
	determination interval <FONT FACE="Symbol, serif"><I>&#61541;</I></FONT>
	is being added. The fact that DP contains only a single known value
	(just like the virtual point, only that the virtual point is not
	related to the non determination interval any longer) was the reason
	for choosing the name of <I>dimensional point.</I> The association
	process to an AAV of a non determination interval is similar with
	the approximation (truncation) of that AAV (which otherwise would
	require an infinity of digits for its display), to a realizable
	value, with a finite number of digits, the difference between them
	being even that non determination interval. It is clear that this
	operation was (tacitly) made by people even since the numbers were
	discovered, but without respecting the definition of the real
	numbers from the mathematics, and by nonchalantly ignoring the clear
	difference between these virtual and common numbers.</P>

<OL START=3>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An informed reader could say that,
	so far, there is nothing new in this approach; the relation
	X.3.6.4.1 is nothing else but a simple integration ranging from <I>x</I><SUB><I>0</I></SUB>
	to <I>x</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB>, in case that the point interval 
	<IMG SRC="x362_html_1ae169a5.gif" NAME="Object656" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=15>
	is replaced by the well-known infinitesimal interval <I>dx</I> from
	the integral calculus. Indeed so, but the objectual approach on the
	mathematics which was initiated in this work eliminates the logical
	contradictions which existed so far and which were not included
	within the textbooks. Such a contradiction is given by the assertion
	&ldquo;<I>A curve is made-up from an ordered set (a series) of
	concatenated points&rdquo;. </I>However, according to the classic
	mathematics, the point&rsquo;s size is zero and no matter how many
	zero-dimensional elements would be concatenated, a zero-dimensional
	result would be obtained anyway. On the other hand, the integral
	calculus solves the problem correctly, in order to conceive a curve,
	a series of curve elements being concatenated, but this time, the
	curve&rsquo;s elements have a certain <U>dimension</U>. However, one
	little formality is still required: the recognition of the existence
	of dimensioned points as <I>realizable</I> objects, and of the
	<I>virtual </I>points (dimensionless points) as <I>non-realizable</I>
	objects (virtual, asymptotic models of the realizable points).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In case of 2D and 3D domains, with
	two or three dimensions, DP will also be either two- or
	three-dimensional. The model of this kind of objects is a synthetic
	object (complex one, but this time, by means of internal composition
	within the model) which consists of two or three one-dimensional
	objects which were above mentioned, associated with a common
	reference system - a virtual point which represents the two or three
	RAV with a simultaneous existence, each of them with its own non
	determination interval, the internal references of each associated
	one-dimensional interval.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">DP model has been also adopted due
	to other reasons, namely because the continuity and consistency of
	the systemic organization of the geometrical objects is therefore
	achieved, which means that any finite realizable curve (or straight
	line) segment may be decomposed into a finite number of adjacent DP,
	any finite surface is decomposable into a finite number of adjacent
	curves (which are also decomposable), any finite volume is
	decomposable in adjacent areas etc. This systemic continuity is also
	required by the existing mathematic system (integral calculus,
	calculus with finite differences) which operates only with
	dimensioned elements (infinitesimal elements have the number of
	dimensions specific to the integration domain).</P>
