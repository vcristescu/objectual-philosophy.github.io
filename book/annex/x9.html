<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always; margin-bottom: 0in;">Annex X.9 &ndash;
SCALARIZATION OF THE VECTORIAL QUANTITIES</H1>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">By considering a
set of material objects which exists at the same time (with
simultaneous existence), the motion processes of these objects shall
be simultaneous as well. The state of these processes decomposed into
SEP shall be represented by an Euler-type vector distribution
(defined in chapter 5), which exists at a moment <I>t</I> (moment
which, according to the objectual philosophy, represents the internal
temporal reference of a temporal interval and not a moment under the
meaning of the classic physics). The vector objects of the Euler
distribution belong to the carrier vectors class and they shall have
their application points in the internal T reference of the moving
objects, the modulus equal to the intensity of the motion process
deployed by that object, and its direction depends on the concurrent
previous processes (if there is no concurrent SEP, which means that
there is no interaction occurred between objects, then, the direction
of the individual SEP remains invariant, <FONT COLOR="#000000">rectilinear</FONT>).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Let us presume that
the Euler distribution of the moving SEP of the objects is a
stochastic (chaotic) one, which means that SEP modulus is included
into a known and finite value interval, and SEP directions are
uniformly distributed in the intervals

evaluated against the axes of reference. It is clear that at the
level of an individual process and during a period short enough in
order to allow that the objects&rsquo; motion velocity to be
invariant, the character of this process is undoubtedly vectorial.
However, the situation may be changed if the temporal observation
interval is longer, so that the velocity of the motion process of an
object to have numerous changes on the direction and modulus. In
chapters 4 and 5, we saw that this type of individual process may be
approximated by means of a series (a set) of concatenated SEP, that
the temporal distribution of these concatenated SEP is a Lagrange
distribution, and the invariant attributes (states) of these abstract
objects can have a common component (one of them is the external
reference) and against it - the specific components of each SEP.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">If
we shall take a more simple example, such as the case of the motions
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">of a single object included into a plane,
the different directions of SEP which make-up the series of
concatenated processes can be evenly distributed within their
existence interval </SPAN>
<IMG SRC="x9_html_m24539742.gif" NAME="Object796" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=21><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,
in other words, any successive direction is equally possible within
the temporal observation interval. In this case, the common component
of these directions is null, and according to the objectual
philosophy, this means that there is no direction. However, the
common component of the modules is different from zero within the
same temporal interval. Therefore, we are dealing with a positive
amount different from zero (the modules&rsquo; mean value), which has
a null direction, otherwise speaking, </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>a
scalar</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">. In this way, an apparently
paradoxical situation occurs, in which a process (a finite series of
concatenated processes is still a process, but a complex one) which
actually existed on the entire temporal observation interval is
represented by a scalar quantity.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">In
the above-mentioned example, we have taken into consideration a
Lagrange distribution (a trajectory) of a single object, and in this
case, the common component from a series of </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>successive</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
processes of a similar object should be determined. The situation is
however similar if we are taking into consideration the common
component of some  </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>simultaneous</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
 SEP (the aforementioned Euler distribution), but in this case, we
are interested  only in the spatial distribution of the SEP with
simultaneous existence, rather than in the temporal distribution.
Here, the situation in which this common component of SEP must be
null is also likely to occur, which means that the coherent component
of the Euler-type vector field should not exist, but in exchange, to
be a common component of the simultaneous SEP modules, that is also a
scalar. In chapter 5, we saw that this case is typical for the 
stochastic fluxes, fluxes which are strictly vectorial at the
elementary level (of SEP), but on the global scale, they have only a
scalar attribute as a result of the vanishing of  the common
direction. This is the notorious case of a gas from a confined and
motionless container, in which SEP are the impulses of the individual
molecules, with a clear vectorial character, but whose common
component is a scalar which is the source of a series of scalar
attributes as well, such as the  pressure, the mean energy per
molecule, so on.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Based
on the data presented so far in this annex, the following conclusions
may be drawn</SPAN>:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="scalarization"></A><SPAN LANG="en-GB">There

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">The necessary
