X.4</FONT> - CONTAINERS</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the objectual philosophy,
a <I><B>container</B></I> is an ensemble of virtual, abstract
realizable or real boundaries, which confine an internal domain
reserved to an object. Based on the type of the contained object, we
shall have:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Virtual </I>containers, which
	contain inside them virtual objects. For example, the virtual object
	<I>the set of the real numbers</I> from mathematics or subsets of
	this set. This object is &ldquo;packed&rdquo; (contained, confined)
	in a virtual container symbolized by the two brackets <I>{}</I>,
	which include a symbol (such as Z, N, R, etc.) which is specific for
	one or more common properties of the constitutive elements, infinite
	in terms of number. In this case (the most generic), the brackets
	are symbols without any other semantic value than the one of
	<U>separator of an internal domain</U>, which can be empty, such as
	for instance the case of the void set 
	<IMG SRC="x4_html_408f015c.gif" NAME="Object681" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=21>,
	where only the virtual internal domain has remained from the set
	object, which is reserved by the two boundaries. In case that the
	set has one or more properties which are common to all the contained
	elements, the contrast between the existence of this property within
	the container&rsquo;s internal domain and its absence in the rest of
	the &ldquo;universe&rdquo;, becomes a property associated to that
	particular container. The virtual containers may contain infinite
	domains (such as the case of the set of numbers which were mentioned
	above {Z}, {N}, {R} etc.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Abstract realizable</I>
	containers, applicable for instance, in case of the <I>set</I>
	object, but this time with a finite and determined number of
	elements, which are all abstract realizable objects (contained by
	the finite ISS). For example, the set of the letters from an
	alphabet, the set of the numbers from a list, etc. Since we are
	talking about sets, the symbols for the boundaries are also the
	brackets with associated semantic values, as in case of the virtual
	containers. For certain sets of abstract objects, with finite
	numbers of elements which are positionally arranged based on one or
	more dimensions, at which the position assigned to an element into
	the internal domain is invariant (for instance, the matrix), there
	will be corresponding symbols for the boundaries of the container,
	others than the brackets (for example, 
	<IMG SRC="x4_html_555b9258.gif" NAME="Object682" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=27>).
	The category of the symbols for denoting the boundaries of the
	abstract realizable containers also includes the separating
	characters from the natural written language (break space, comma,
	dot, brackets etc.) which have the role to define the internal
	domain of a number, word, collocation, sentence, phrase etc.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Real</I> (material)<I>
	</I>containers which define the inside of a real (material) object.
	Based on the generic model of the material system proposed by the
	present paper, the result is that a real container is made-up from a
	real bounding surface (RBS), either it is natural or artificial.
	This type of container is minutely described in chapter 7, which is
	focused on the natural RBS.</P>
