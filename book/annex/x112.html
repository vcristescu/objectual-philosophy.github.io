case of the bio-systems living on Earth, the generating medium
(reference medium, L</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SUB>A</SUB></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">-type,
peripheral medium) is the planetary hydrosphere (with all its
existence forms: oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, subterranean water), in
which all the elements necessary for a biosystem structure are spread
(as solutions, emulsions, suspensions etc.). For the time being, it
is impossible to mention what were the primordial elementary
bio-systems, but at the current stage of the bio-systems evolution on
Earth, the most simple bio-systems which comply with the four
above-mentioned criteria are the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><U>prokaryotic
cells</U></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
If the set of the abiotic MS from the hydrosphere is a generating set
for the set of the living cells from the planet, the set of the
prokaryotic cells is also a generating set for all the other cellular
or pluricellular bio-system types.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
fulfillment of the bio-system criteria no 1, 3 and 4 is clear and
well-known, the feeding, excretion, reproduction processes of the
living cells being well-known. As for the  existence of the criterion
2, the chemical synthesis processes based on the information
contained into some ISS with an universal syntax for the bio-systems
on the Earth are certainly known and these are the DNA or RNA
molecules. Therefore, the intracellular chemical syntheses are
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>information processing operations</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
of structural synthesis. The processing of the information related to
the external medium of a cell are not known enough yet, but there is
no doubt that they exist because, without these processes, the other
processes such as feeding, reaction to the unfavorable environmental
conditions etc. could not be achieved (we are talking about free
living cells, which have to manage by themselves, not about the cells
belonging to a pluricellular organism).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
bio-systems must be able to distinguish (to deploy an objectual
separation) the &ldquo;good&rdquo; systems (useful, which can be, for
instance, ingested) from the outside medium, from the &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
ones (which may be considered as a danger for the bio-system&rsquo;s
integrity). These performances cannot be achieved without the
existence of an internal IPS. We must also take into account that the
most advanced IPS which can be currently found on the planet is the
human brain, containing a cell which is specialized in the
information processing, that is the neuron. But, this huge
information processing capacity, associated to a specialized cell was
not able to occur without the existence of some elementary
information processing operations, processes which are specific to
any living cell and which have the same ISS as an information basis -
the DNA and RNA molecules.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Based
on the existence of an internal IPS, the bio-systems are endowed with
a characteristic which did not exist at the abiotic systems: the
selective permeability to the fluxes. In this way, the access through
RBS both for the immergent fluxes and for the emergent ones is
strictly controlled; the access to the inside is allowed to MS which
are recognized as &ldquo;good&rdquo; </FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">(</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>p</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>k</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>=1</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">)

prokaryotic cells (such as for instance, mitochondria or
chloroplasta). This means that an eukaryotic cell is a system which

are fragments (subsystems) from the composition of a cell which may
exist in the external environment, as a result of the destruction of
the cellular membrane (RBS), but these fragments alone cannot fulfill
all the main criteria for a bio-system, therefore, they are not
bio-systems any longer, but only some compounds with a biotic origin.
For example, a class of commonly systems which is considered as
belonging to the bio-systems category, the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>viruses</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
are proved (according to the objectual philosophy) to not be
bio-systems. These MS made-up from a DNA or RNA fragment covered by a

access control system through the plasma membrane of some cells and
in this way they get inside. Here, any genetic information (contained
in a DNA or RNA fragment) goes into &ldquo;the replication machinery&rdquo;
embedded in any living cell, and thus, the virus&rsquo; genetic
information determines its deviant reproduction until the destruction
of the penetrated cell.</FONT></P>

X.11.2.2: The situation is similar with the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">manufacturing

container, it is clear that they will remain there without being able
to self-reproduce until the moment they will casually reach a proper
environment (a technologically developed society able to understand
the plan and to manufacture the product). If the product will prove
to be harmful, it is likely that the society would be destroyed (the
