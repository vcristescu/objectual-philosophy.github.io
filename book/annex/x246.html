Whereas according to the classic approach (presented in textbooks),
the thermal energy of a medium means the kinetic energy of the atoms

</SPAN></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">degrees of freedom</SPAN><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,
</SPAN></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">according to the objectual approach,
the two forms of energy are clearly separated, since they are

It is clear that this approach on the thermal energy could not be
conceived without a close connection with the isotomic character of
the photonic EF, by establishing a maximum value for their effective
section (which allows their propagation in the interstitial space
between the atoms), by also considering that the interactions between
the atomic EP must be synchronic, resulting therefore, the
possibility of photons release by means of a simple collision between
atoms, so on.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

Let us make a short analysis of these heat conveyance processes, by
taking into account the flux categories presented in chapter 5.</FONT></P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>Radiation</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
	is a heat conveyance process whose support - the flux elements - are
	acknowledged even by the current physics to be thermal photons,
	which means that there is no atom or molecules flux across the flux
	pathway. Well, my dear reader, we have seen that a flux means the
	transfer of an amount, but that amount which is about to be
	submitted must also have a material support (the objects which own
	the property). If the support of the thermal energy would be also
	the atoms (with their energy divided into degrees of freedom), how
	is it possible to convey the heat without the support atoms? This
	flagrant contradiction which was let aside and not analyzed by
	textbooks was also the starting point of redefining the thermal

	is a heat conveyance process which is similar to the propagation,
	also characterized by the non-existence of coherent atoms or
	molecules fluxes on the direction of the thermal flux. In this case,
	we may argue that the translation/vibration motions of the elements
	from the atomic medium (symbolized by the so-called &ldquo;phonons&rdquo;)
	are transmissible, similarly to the acoustic waves, which is very
	true, but the perturbations of these motions are transmitted with
	the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>sound propagation speed</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
	through that medium, whereas the heat conveyance is made at much
	slower rates. If we are taking into account the above-mentioned
	issues, the reason for this low transmittance rate becomes obvious:
	the medium of the thermal photons is forced </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>to
	diffuse</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> through the interstitial

	as an ultimate type of thermal flux is different from the other two
	types because there is a coherent atomic (molecular) flux which is
	guided in a certain direction, flux which carries the heat much more
	efficient and faster than the conduction. According to this paper,
	this flux type is nothing but the motion of the whole medium,
	together with the medium of the interstitial photons, and in this
	way, the coherent displacement component being added to the
	diffusion speed, the thermal photons medium having the same common

underlined in the definition X.24.6.2 have the role to highlight the
fact that the thermal photons which are found at a given moment into
a specific medium may be generated either from the outside (in this
case, they are produced in other part, the medium had a zero
contribution to their generation), or from inside the medium by means
of the repeated interactions deployed between the elements, and in
such case, their energy is the thermal contribution of the medium.
For example, the heating of a gas by means of compression, without an
external heat input and without losses (adiabatic compression),
occurs only as a result of the thermal contribution of that medium.
Obviously, the process could not be possible without an external EF
which produces the compression (piston motion), but this external
flux </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>is kinetic, non thermal</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
(the heat transfer between the kinetic flux - that is the moving
piston - and the compressed medium may be neglected because the
piston may be considered in a thermal equilibrium with the medium
before the compression).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">There is a major
difference between the thermal energy due to the thermal contribution
of the medium and the one which is due to some external fluxes of
thermal photons (external heat sources), difference which is not
related to the carrier medium or to the generating process but it is
focused on the transfer rate of this energy into the space occupied
by that medium. If the external thermal flux is transmitted to the
medium&rsquo;s elements through diffusion (in case of thermal
conduction), that is a very slow process, the thermal flux which is
generated through thermal contribution (due to the pressure
variations) is transmitted with a velocity having a size grade
similar with the propagation rate of the pressure variation (sound
speed) in that medium. Otherwise speaking, the temperature variations
caused by the pressure variations are much more faster than the
temperature variations caused by the thermal conduction.</FONT></P>

X.24.6.2: The concept of </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>thermal
contribution</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"> of a NM, introduced by the
objectual philosophy is very useful for a coherent (logical)
understanding of some processes deployed into the real world,
processes which are explained by the current science community in a
way which is not agreed by the present paper. It all starts from the
net delimitation introduced by the objectual philosophy between the
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>thermal energy</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">,
which has as carriers (support material objects) exclusively the
thermal photons, and the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>baric energy,
</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">with carriers such as EP, NE, NC, AT,
MO etc. which are MS with a rest mass (&ldquo;heavy ones&rdquo;).
Both energy &ldquo;forms&rdquo; are distributed on some stochastic
material fluxes which are inter-penetrated (they claim the same
spatial domain) and which, due to this reason, undergo a close
interaction process. Since there are two distinct media, there are
also two different parameters which characterize the energy status of
the two media: the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>temperature</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">,
specific to the photonic medium and the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>pressure</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">,
specific to the baric medium. For a certain type of NM, made-up from
the same type of atoms, under equilibrium conditions, in which the EF
re-circulated between the atomic and photonic medium are equal (and
in counter direction) and there is no energy exchange deployed with
the exterior, at a certain value of the pressure parameter will
correspond a specific value of the temperature parameter. The
existence of the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><U>interaction</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">
process between the photonic and baric media also creates an
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><U>interdependence</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">
between temperature and pressure (such as, for instance, the ideal
gas law for the atomic G media which shall be described later on). As
a result of the interdependence between the temperature and the
pressure of a medium, an adiabatic pressure variation leads to a
variation with the same temperature trend, that is a variation which
is much more faster than the temperature variations obtained as a
result of a heat transfer (an external output of thermal photons).
This temperature leap which reflects a leap of the thermal energy
contained into the photonic medium is generated even by means of a
thermal contribution of the baric medium, namely, the generation of
thermal photons as a result of the mechanical excitation of the
peripheral EP. The interdependence process between pressure and
temperature is evident for both directions of the pressure
variations. The instantaneous melting of the meteorites at the impact
with the solid surface of a planet, auto-ignition of the fuel mixture
through the rapid compression into the Diesel engines, the metals
welding as a result of the shock wave produced by an explosion, are
just few of the examples which prove the rapid temperature increase
(without external thermal input) caused by a rapid pressure increase.
A special case belonging to this category is represented by the huge
temperature increase as a result of the cavitation (the implosion of
a cavity which is temporarily made-up into the L</SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-US">A</SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-US">-type
media), an increase which may reach to 10</SPAN><SUP><SPAN LANG="en-US">4</SPAN></SUP><SPAN LANG="en-US">
K and generates the so-called sonoluminiscence or, in some cases even
a temperature level of 10</SPAN><SUP><SPAN LANG="en-US">6</SPAN></SUP><SPAN LANG="en-US">
K, at which even the nuclear dissociation processes are triggered</SPAN><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="#sdfootnote8sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A><SPAN LANG="en-US">.
If a coherent fluid flux (a stream) is deliberately generated into a
thermally balanced G or L medium, the static pressure (thermal
contribution generator) into the moving area shall be more reduced
and consequently, the temperature in this area shall be reduced. We
may find this process by ourselves if we blow strongly on one of our
hands; we shall instantly feel a sensation of coldness in the area
which is under the incidence of the air flux. For explaining this
fact, your teachers who taught you when you were children gave you a
funny explanation: the temperature drop is due to the vaporization of
water which is on the surface of the skin. But, my dear reader, try
to make the same experiment by covering your hand with a thin dry
plastic bag and in this way, the water vaporization is out of the
question. You will observe the same temperature drop into the area of
the air flux, and this decrease is proportional with the flux
intensity. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">At the end of

	the excited orbital. If we are taking into account the fact that all
	these durations are added to the propagation process of the photonic
	flux deployed through the interstitial spaces of the atomic medium,
	it seems to be very clear why the diffusion of this flux is so slow.
