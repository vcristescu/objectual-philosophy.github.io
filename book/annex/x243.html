macroscopic radiators), although both of them are made-up from the

space. As it can be found by looking at the definition X.24.3.1, the

consist either in a nuclear peripheral proton and the related

with the atomic photons and in the second one, with the neutronic

photon classes, but there is a quantitative one, the energy domain of
the atomic photons ranging within infrared and X-ray radiation, while
the neutronic photons have energy values mainly within the </SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Comment
X.24.3.2: By considering the generic MS model and taking into account
the fact that this kind of system can be maintained only as a result
of constructive interactions which imply synchronism, it is clear for
the reader why the objectual philosophy cannot sustain the purely
probabilistic hypothesis (dictated by the so-called &ldquo;probability
waves&rdquo;) of the EP motions on the occupied orbitals within the
structure of an atom. Obviously, any deterministic motion (as we have
seen in the chapter focused on fluxes) has also a non-determination
degree (otherwise, it would not be </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">realizable),
but there is clearly a deterministic (invariant) component which
gives stability to the atomic structure and to all the objects which
they are able to make-up.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Consequently, the photon
flux is a T+R flux; the component T is the translation one with the
propagation speed, and the component R is the result of the vectorial
composition of all the rotation and revolution motions of the
releasing EP.</P>

X.24.3.3: The </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">energy fluxes T+R (the photon
fluxes also belong to this class) are not like they would seem to be
some &ldquo;exotic fluxes&rdquo; which are specific only to the
photons, but they are much more spread in the world. The first
example of this kind of fluxes, which are very common in the material
processing field are the splintering tools with rotation motion
(borers, drills, so on) where the component T of the flux represents
the axial advance motion of the tool, and the component R, its
rotation (splintering) motion. Another very common example is the
helicopters and propeller aircrafts, where the flux R of the
propellers produces the flux T+R of the air, that is a flux which
generates both the sustentation (in case of the helicopters) and the
running of this kind of aircrafts. At last, if we are thinking well,
most of the fluxes used for the propulsion of the objects through NM
and which operate based on propellers or turbines, belong to T+R
type. All the bullets shot by rifles are also T+R fluxes, the
rotation motion generated by the rifled barrel having the role to
provide a gyroscopic stabilization of the position of the bullet&rsquo;s
axis along its pathway. Besides these examples from the &ldquo;tangible&rdquo;
world, we have seen in chapters 6 and 7 that the atomic or molecular
fluxes from the G media are T+R fluxes as well.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Since
the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">photon is an open flux (on the
propagation direction), it cannot be localized unless its propagation
is deployed across a confined pathway, and in such case, the
localization is possible within a volume which includes the pathway,
as we have seen in the chapter about fluxes. Based on the
above-mentioned issues and of the ones described in the chapter
focused on fluxes, it is clear that a propagation flux can have a
constant effective section only if there is a way to close it on the
directions which are different from the propagation-displacement one,
closure which can be related to the rotation component of the photon
(the rotation, as a confinement method, was indicated in the chapter
focused on fluxes).</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Therefore,
the photon has a finite energy content (given by the Plank&rsquo;s
relation </SPAN>

cylindrical theoretical surface which contains inside it all this
energy amount.</P>

X.24.3.4: This is a quantic aspect which is </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">accepted
by the systemic philosophy, which means that the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><U>energy

interpretation of Plank&rsquo;s constant is much more different as

could not be otherwise if you have read the action&rsquo;s definition

the same dimensions </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">(J</SPAN><FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61655;</FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">s=J/Hz).
A spectrum is an abstract object consisting in an energetic
distribution with a frequency support domain. Would you not consider
more appropriate a combination between a frequency and a spectral
density rather than a combination between a frequency and an action?
We must take into account that at the moment when the Planck
distribution of the thermal photon was conceived, there was no
knowledge in the field of the spectral analysis as compared to the
current one, but, in exchange, the mechanical thinking (with its
concept of action) was prevalent.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
