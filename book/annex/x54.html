with a velocity surplus (as compared to the mean values) and the ones
with a velocity deficit. In this case, the positive or negative
character of the two complementary properties is given only by the
symbol of the difference between the value of the molecular velocity
and the mean value, therefore, by a quantitative value. However, for
people, this symbol is a qualitative attribute because any school boy
knows that positive numbers are different in terms of quality as
compared to the negative ones, although they are different (at the
same modulus) only by the symbol which is placed in front of them.</P>

X.5.4.1: If the reader has already read the chapter 2, he will
probably notice a discrepancy between the denomination for some of
the Gauss-type distributions presented in the current scientific
papers (or of other distributions of an attribute on a set of
objects, such as the Maxwell or Plank distribution) and the name of
the distributions given according to the model used in the
mathematics field (which is also used in the present paper). In
chapter 2, we saw that a distribution has a distributed attribute
(dependent variable displayed on the vertical axis) and a support
attribute (independent variable displayed on the horizontal axis),
with a set of assignment relations deployed between their values
(relations which can be symbolically invariant - functions - such as
the case of the above-mentioned distributions). The name of a
distribution must specify the distributed attribute and its support.
It is clear that as regards the Gauss-type distribution, the support
(mathematic) attribute is the variable <I>x</I>, and <FONT FACE="Symbol, serif"><I>&#61554;</I></FONT>
(number of the elements which own that value) is a distributed
attribute (<U>this</U> should be put at the genitive in order to show
the affiliation to all the support objects). On the other hand, the
elements belonging to the set of objects are material supports (ISS)
of the information regarding the existence of the property <I>x</I>,
but they are not the distribution&rsquo;s support and their number is
the distributed attribute. It is compulsory that a clear distinction
to be made between the notion of <U>distribution&rsquo;s support</U>
(as an independent variable), and the one of material support of an
information (ISS). Because the denominations of the above-mentioned
distributions are quite frequent in the specialized papers, we shall
further tolerate them although they are inaccurate in terms of the
distributions definition.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
