As we have seen in chapter 7, the balance of the fluxes generated by
the interaction process (collision) of a MS couple shows two pairs of
equal and opposites directions fluxes, the fluxes which are normal on
RBS into the impact point and the tangential fluxes (whose direction
is parallel with the tangent plane on RBS at the same impact point).
The medium where this composition of fluxes takes place (the medium
located into the transition volume of RBS) is the peripheral medium
of the atoms, namely, of the peripheral electrons. It is clear that
these fluxes, once they enter into the electronic medium, will be
able to disturb the state of the electrons involved in this process.
The mutual perturbation process of the peripheral electrons within
the two systems, perturbation which is partly &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo;,
as we have seen in the previous sections, and partly photonic, leads
to the emission of photons which represents the interstitial photonic
medium (the support of the thermal energy stored in that particular
medium), and the emergent flux of these photons through RBS of that
medium (internal traflux) represents the <U>thermal equilibrium
radiation</U> of the equivalent black body. Therefore, there is no
thermal radiation in the absence of the interactions (collisions)
between the elements of a distributed material system. Accordingly,
it is improper to talk about &ldquo;the temperature of a single
electron&rdquo;, statement which is used more frequently regarding
the particles released by the sun.</P>

from the ideal gas equation are the ones specific to an energy, but
this fact does not mean that every time we talk about energy, we must
associate it with the temperature; it is absurd to discuss about the
temperature of an isolated EP and which moves across a non-disturbed
rectilinear pathway (without collisions), which is obviously owner of
a kinetic translation energy, but this energy does not belong to any
of the thermal photons, therefore, according to the definitions
presented so far, we cannot talk about thermal energy and about its
specific attribute, that is the temperature.  Although the thermal
photons are the support of the thermal energy, its temperature is
also out of question in case of an isolated thermal photon. A flux of
thermal photons (the flux radiated by a warm body) has a Plank
distribution which is in correspondence with a certain temperature of
the flux source, but this temperature is an attribute </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><U>of
the medium of thermal photons contained into the source body</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">
and not of the photon flux which emerges from the body. Otherwise
speaking, the frequency distribution of the photons from a radiating

body, information concerning its thermal state.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
According to a preliminary analysis, the temperature is a statistic
amount, characteristic to a <U>set</U> of MS (such as AT, MO or EP)
which are <U>under interaction</U>, and it is proportional with the
global energy density of the photonic flux produced and stored into
that set as a result of the collisions deployed between the system&rsquo;s
elements, or coming from the outside, but which is under equilibrium
with that set. It is impossible during this phase of phrasing the
temperature definition to establish exactly what is the specific
weight (contribution) of the two components of the kinetic (baric)
impact flux (the normal and tangential component), however, one may
clearly state that:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The <U>normal</U> component of the
	variation on RBS of the impact kinetic fluxes (T component collinear
	with a common normal line of the two inter-penetrated RBS at the
	moment of impact) is the main cause of the statistic attribute
	called <U>pressure</U> belonging to the support medium of these
	fluxes.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fluxes of the photons released
	as a result of these impacts make-up the <U>medium of the
	interstitial thermal photons</U>, that is a carrier medium<I> </I>of
	the <U>thermal energy</U> (energy made-up from the thermal
	contribution of the atomic or molecular media, as well as from the
	external heat intake).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under isolation conditions,
	without an external intake of fluxes, but also without flux losses
	towards outside, the two internal energy fluxes stored inside the
	medium - stochastic atomic (or molecular) EF and photonic stochastic
	EF - must be balanced, the mean intensity of the atomic kinetic flux
	(T+R) being equal and counter marked with the mean intensity of the
	opposition flux exerted by the thermal photons (also T+R).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pressure attribute, as it was
	defined in chapter 7, also belongs to the fluxes of thermal photons
	(and they also have a variation of the normal T component on the
	impact orbital), but the weight of this component is much reduced as
	compared to the kinetic component T of the atoms. In other words,
	there is also a <U>baric contribution</U> of the thermal photons
	medium, but this contribution is insignificant as compared to the
	baric contribution of the atomic impulses (under the common
	conditions found at the surface of Earth but not into the stars&rsquo;
	core).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main energetic component of
	the photons is the component R which is able to transmit rotation
	fluxes towards the driven object (electron or group of neighbor
	electrons), fluxes which may have common components across the RBS
	of an atom (namely, a partly R coherency). These common components
	may lead to the activation of some full rotations of the atom,
	rotations which may exceed the common vibration rates (becoming
	irreversible)  and which can therefore cause the phase change of the
	atomic medium, from S into L (melting) or from L into G
	(vaporization, see the criteria of media classification from the
	chapter 6).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The temperature, as an attribute
	specific to the thermal photons medium, attribute which is
	characteristic to a set of photons with the energy per element
	strictly depending on its frequency, cannot be separated even by the
	fact that the energy contained in this set <U>is distributed on a
	frequency support</U>. As we have seen in the chapter focused on
	objects, each abstract object of such kind has an internal reference
	system (either abstract or natural one), which represents that
	object within its external relations.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Well, this is the starting point for an
objectual definition of temperature, taking into account the fact
that the thermal energy is a distributed attribute, and that
distribution (Plank distribution) has the thermal photons frequency
as its support.</P>
