TRANSMISSIBLE ATTRIBUTES AND TRANSACTIONS</H1>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The attributes of
the real objects can be divided in two categories:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Transmissible </I>attributes,
	which can be transmitted (transferred through a flux) from one
	object to another, during a process which is named <I>transaction</I>;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Non-transmissible </I>attributes,
	which remain specific to that particular object (stored inside it)
	until the expiry of its lifespan.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">For becoming
transmissible, an attribute must be carried by an <I>open flux</I>,
that is a transfer process from one location (position) to another,
and obviously, the flux must exist between the real objects which
undergo an attribute exchange. Among the transmissible attributes,
the <I>energy</I> and <I>information</I> are the most important ones
for the objectual philosophy.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">When we described
the SM model, we saw that a real agent flux which covers the system&rsquo;s
RBS generates a change on the internal state first, and then, on the
external state, change which is called <I>action</I>. If the state
changes occur in two MS as a result of the mutual actions of the
fluxes released by the two MS and mutually received, we are dealing
with an <I>interaction </I>process.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As it was noticed
at the description of the generic IPS model, each distinct flux type
released by a MS and which can be perceived (noticed, detected) by
that IPS, it means a distinct <I>qualitative attribute</I> of that
emitting MS. These material fluxes released by a MS and partly
received by IPS, represent the support of the information associated
by IPS to the perceived material system, and the certification
(undertaken also by IPS) on the <I>existence</I> of this MS shall
take place as a result of receiving this information.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Taking into account
the above-mentioned issues, this means that the <I>transmissible
</I>attributes are related to <I>active</I> (open) <I>fluxes</I> as
their material support, and the <I>non-transmissible</I> ones have
<I>closed fluxes</I> as their support, or objects placed inside the
object to which they belong to. As for the interactive systems, the
flux exchange processes (of transmissible attributes) which take
place during the interaction are also named <I>transactions</I>
because they are similar with the processes of assets exchange
developed in the economic-financial field.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">For beginning the
study of the transaction process, a classification of their phases
(stages, states) would be required:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Initial state S</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
	when there was no exchange between the two objects, and the
	transmissible attribute (which may be transacted) of each object is
	stored inside the object, this attribute stockpile representing the
	result of the previous transactions. Under this state, the  two
	objects may be considered completely isolated (in terms of the
	transmissible attribute);</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Transaction process</I>
	(interaction) during which the transmissible attribute fluxes are
	transferred from one object to another;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Final state S</I><SUB><I>f</I></SUB>
	, occurred after the completion of the transfer process, in which
	the two objects have another distribution of the transmissible
	attribute as compared to the initial state (a modification of the
	internal stockpile), and where once again, the two objects are
	isolated (until the next transaction).</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">An important
observation: the two states which limit (as any other SEP) the
transaction process both belong to the same processual class (in case
of the &ldquo;physical&rdquo; interaction processes, they can be two
positions, two velocities etc.).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Let us assume that
there are two objects <SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>Ob</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>A</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
and </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>Ob</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>B</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">

process between the two objects is a complex process, made-up from
two simultaneous processes (therefore, according to the
classification from chapter 4, there is a collective and specific
process), and since we have information only about the two states,
initial and final, the two simultaneous processes shall be considered
as <U>linear</U> (with even density), namely, two SEP with a common

X.10.1: Now, it is the moment to draw the reader&rsquo;s attention on
a major approach difference regarding the transaction notion
(property exchange as a result of a flux), against the classic
approach presented in text-books and in other papers. The notion of
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>null transaction</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
cannot exist in the objectual philosophy field, because any property
(either objectual or processual) which owns the null quantitative
attribute means that it does not exist. The fact that a transaction
is made-up from two simultaneous non-zero processes (fluxes) means
that these processes exist even if the state variation is null
(equitable</SPAN><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><B>
</B></SPAN></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">transaction). In case of this
latter transaction, because </SPAN>
<IMG SRC="x10_html_m778dda77.gif" NAME="Object809" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=49 HEIGHT=25><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,
the classic approach states that there was no occurrence of property
exchange. On the contrary, the objectual philosophy upholds that
there was a transfer (transaction) process but, in equal quantities
and opposite senses. This approach is used for instance in case of
the energy exchange (by means of the energy fluxes) between two MS
which are under equilibrium, which deploy static, equal and counter
direction forces.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">So
far, we have discussed only about a transaction deployed between a
single couple of objects. In the real world, where there are lots of
objects with a simultaneous existence (a DS in which only the
proximity elements are in interaction, or a CS in which, besides the
interactions with the proximity elements, each element must be also
subjected to the permanent interaction with the central system), the
transactions can be collective, multiple, simultaneous or successive.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
case of the successive interactions (temporally concatenated) is
worth mentioning because the effects generated by this succession are
very interesting. Let us assume that we are dealing with the same
couple of objects </FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>Ob</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>A</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
and </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>Ob</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>B</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
which were above mentioned, only that, instead of a single
transaction, we shall have a series of successive transactions. In
this case, we shall take into account the temporal distribution of
the attribute transactions of one of the two objects, that is a
distribution which represents (as we have seen in chapter 4) a series
of concatenated SEP. In case of such a distribution (which is a first
rank derived distribution), the primary distribution is represented
by the temporal series of the transmissible attribute stock of the
researched object, between two transactions. Let us assume that this
series for </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>Ob</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>A</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
is </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>e</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>A</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>(t</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>1</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>),

<IMG SRC="x10_html_11027892.gif" NAME="Object811" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=57 HEIGHT=21><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
is the support interval for the aforementioned SEP. There are only
two values of the series which are relevant for this topic: initial
</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>e</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>A</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>(t</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>1</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>)</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
and final </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>e</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>A</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>(t</I></SPAN><SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>n</I></SPAN></SUB><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>)</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">.
The difference between the two states of the transmissible attribute
after a series of transactions shows us what kind of transaction (out
of the three above-mentioned types) was </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>prevalent
</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">for a particular object. Naturally, if
the two states are equal, the object had mostly </SPAN><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">even</SPAN></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
</SPAN></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">transactions, if the difference is
negative, the unfavourable transactions have prevailed and if it is
positive, the favourable ones were predominant. This predominance of
a transaction type for a series of successive transactions which </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>have
affected a specific object</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> is the cause
of the unevenness of the natural distributions based on Gauss
distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">As
we have mentioned in the annex X.5.4, there is an internal reference
in case of these natural distributions, against which the
distribution elements can have a property </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>surplus
</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">(in relation to the mean value) and
elements with a property </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>deficit</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">.
The elements with a property surplus took benefits (as a result of
the repeated interactions) from a series of prevalently favourable
transactions, and the ones with deficit, were affected by a series of
predominantly unfavourable transactions. While in case of the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>natural</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
distributions (such as for instance, the distribution of the
molecular velocity rates in a gas), the objects with a property
surplus or deficit are not always the same, fact which certifies the
process &ldquo;naturalness&rdquo; (namely, the lack of an artificial
interference on these processes), as regards the distribution of the
valuable resources on the humans&rsquo; society, the situation is
much more different&hellip;.</SPAN></P>
