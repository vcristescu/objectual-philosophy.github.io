objects</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As it was
previously mentioned and as we are about to minutely see in chapter
8, the properties of an object, both the qualitative and quantitative
ones, are assessed by means of an IPS, the notion of <I>object</I>
being valid only for this special type of MS (your brain is also a
part of this class, my dear reader). We saw that all the properties
of an object must have a simultaneous existence, namely, to have an
unique value of a continuous and evenly variable attribute, free from
any of the object&rsquo;s attributes - that is <I>the temporal
attribute.</I> The criterion P6 must be fulfilled both for the
existence of the elementary and compound objects, otherwise speaking,
the total number of objects which are constitutive parts of another
object must have a <U>simultaneous</U> existence (even if these are
the constitutive elements of our astronomic Universe), and the
properties of the constitutive objects shall be added to the
properties of our new compound object.</P>

3.4.1: For example, in case of the compound objects from figure
3.3.1, R<SUB>2</SUB> reference is an inner reference for O<SUB>2</SUB>-type
of object, but an outer one, as regards O<SUB>3</SUB>-type of objects
from its composition. Similarly, R<SUB>1</SUB> reference is inner
reference for the object O<SUB>1</SUB>, but an outer one, both as
regards O<SUB>2</SUB> and O<SUB>3</SUB>-type<SUB> </SUB>of objects.
The absolute reference R<SUB>0</SUB> is an external reference for any
kind of object.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">We have noticed
that the properties of an object are distributed inside the object&rsquo;s
support domain and they are called inner properties. In case of the
compound objects, besides the inner attributes of each component,
other properties are also associated to the objects which make-up the
object, whose values are determined against the common reference.
These properties are therefore <I>external </I>for the constitutive
objects, but they are internal for the compound object.</P>

3.4.2:</B> The <B>external attributes</B> of an object are those
properties which are assigned to <U>the inner reference system</U> of
an object, and which are determined against an <U>external reference
system.</U></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
inner reference of the compound object is therefore a common
reference to all the constitutive objects (elements) of this object.
Since the attributes of an object must be invariant, the relations
between the constitutive objects must be also invariant, because
these relations are inner properties of the compound object.</FONT></P>

formation of new objects by means of the combination in a compound

their external attributes.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: #f2f2f2; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.01in 0.06in"><A NAME="int_comp"></A>

3.4.4:</B> The <B>internal composition </B>(synonym &ndash; <B>model
composition</B>) is the formation of new objects by adding new
elements to the inner (model) structure of the object.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the general definition of the
object was presented, we talked about a set of properties and
afterwards, when we have focused on the elementary object, this set
was reduced to a single property. It therefore results that a
compound object is also that object which was obtained by means of
superposition of some distributions of different attributes on the
same support domain. In this case, the support reference remains the
same, by adding only the references for the distributions of newly
added attributes. Within such a composition, the object&rsquo;s model
structure is altered, so that the result is an internal composition.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Other way of achieving compound objects
is by means of the combination of the objects with the same model,
but with disjoint support domains. The external attribute which is
associated in such case to the elements of the compound object is for
instance, the space position of the inner reference system of each
element, against the reference system of the compound object. This is
an example of the external composition of objects. In this case, the
condition that each object to have its own support domain, requires
that the support domain of the constitutive objects to be distinct
(disjoint). The inner domain of the compound object will be made-up
from the union of its inner elements domains.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: #f2f2f2; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.01in 0.06in"><A NAME="compact"></A>
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Definition
3.4.5:</B> The <B>compact object </B>is an object whose inner domain
is equal to the sum (union) of the individual inner domains of the
constitutive objects.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Otherwise speaking,
the inner domain of a compact object does not contain intervals which
belong to none of the inner objects, even if this domain is made-up
through the combination (composition) of some disjoint domains (which
are in contiguous relations). An example of compact object is the
political map of the world (see annex X.2), which displays a compound
object made-up from the adjacent union of the state&rsquo;s inner
domains, where there is no bit of dry land which was let unassigned
to the various existing states. Not any compound object is compact as
well; for example, the object called planetary system (PS) is not a
compact object, so as the object galaxy (GX), but both types of
compound objects have their own reference system against which some
elements of the inner reference systems are under invariant
dependence relations (invariance between some limits and along
certain duration).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The compact objects
must comply both with the condition settled by the definition 3.4.5
and by the criterion P4 belonging to the general object model, that
is, the global domains of two compound compact objects with a
<U>simultaneous existence</U> must be disjoint (adjacent, at most).
In case of the material systems, as we are about to see in chapter 7,
the support domain is spatial, so that the following basic principle
is valid for this class of objects:</P>

3.4.2: Space-time exclusion principle of compact MS, deducted
according to the object<SPAN LANG="en-US">&rsquo;</SPAN>s existence
criteria (criteria mentioned in the general object model section),
resulting as a logical conclusion of these criteria, conclusion valid
only for a particular class belonging to the general class of objects
(which can be also abstract, not only material). The underlining made
within the principle enunciation has the role of attract the reader&rsquo;s
attention that the principle is only applicable for the compact
objects. As for the non-compact objects, there are domains of the
support attribute which were not occupied by objects (that is the
interstitial, free domains), which are domains available for other
objects with simultaneous existence.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">It is very
important to notice that the process of objects composition is
external for the <U>elements of a compound object</U> (if the
components model is unaltered), while in case of the <U>generated
compound object</U>, we are dealing with <U>an internal composition</U>
because the model of the compound object is totally different as
compared to the components model, even if these components are
identical.</P>

others) the number Z and N, otherwise speaking, for nuclear model,

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">For a proper
operation with objects and with relations between them, before
proceeding to a more minutely description of the abstract objects
(which shall be made in chapter 9), we shall briefly assert that the
representation of an object which is meant for a certain perception
organ (sense) is made according to certain rules which links the
representation structure (which depends on the inner attributes of
the sense organ) to the structure of the represented object. The
entire set of these rules makes-up a <I>syntax</I> and each sensorial
organ needs its own syntax. For example, as regards the sight
perception system of the human, the visual syntax is being used
(proper for this sensorial organ), which is divided in two
sub-syntaxes: the literal and graphical syntax. In case of the
hearing perception system, there is the auditory syntax (which is
also divided in the phonetic and musical syntax).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Within the
visual-literal syntax (mainly used in this paper), an object <I>Ob</I>
is represented with the following simplified structure:</P>

boundaries (even of the elementary object), <I>e</I><SUB><I>x</I></SUB>
(where <I>X = Ob, A, B </I>etc.) is the existential attribute
(quantitative) conjunctively related to the qualitative property <I>X</I>,
and the operator <I>op</I> is a composition operator. Between the
existential attribute of the compound object (represented by the
symbol from the left side of relation 3.4.1) and the existential
attributes of their components, there is at least one dependence
relation.</P>

on the inner domain of the object <I>Ob</I>. The support attribute

specific components</B></I> (differential, disjoint) of the two
objects. These two classes of information components, associated to a
set of objects, are basic abstract objects according to the objectual
philosophy. Based on these, we would be able to make many things in
the following chapters, one of them being the modelling of the
information processing systems from biotic IPS, or making us to
understand processes which are difficult or impossible to understand
so far, such as the abstraction processes deployed in the human mind.
The extraction of these components is made by means of abstract
processes which occur only within the biotic IPS (for the time
being), and they are symbolized in this paper by two types of
functions (equivalent with the functions from the programming
languages which also represent abstract processes)

for the extraction of the specific component <I>D</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB>
of each operand against the common component. Within these functions,

are the function&rsquo;s operands (arguments), the abstract objects
whose common and specific components are interesting for us and which
can be as many as possible, but finitary. In case of the relations
3.4.6, 3.4.7 and 3.4.8, these functions are explicitly indicated.</P>
