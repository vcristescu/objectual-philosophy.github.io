<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">3.5 Reference
objects</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the
above-mentioned issues, we have noticed that any quantitative value
(existential attribute) of a property is determined through a
difference against other invariant value - reference value. This
evaluation is made (as we are about to see further on) by a
information processing system (IPS), the only type of material system
able to distinguish the object&rsquo;s attributes one from another,
and to establish their existence degree. We have seen in chapter 2
that a distribution consists of a set of value-assignment relations
of an attribute distributed on a support domain, without establishing
the way how the assigned value may be evaluated. Now, it is time to
assert that each of these values are evaluated (by an IPS) against
the reference value, therefore, this kind of value shall be required
for each assignment relation. Thus, we are dealing with another
distribution - reference distribution - in which the distributed
attribute is even the reference value, this distribution clearly
having the same support as the distribution meant to be evaluated.
The value allotted within the reference distribution is invariant,
and is equal to zero, in case of the absolute reference. This <U>uniform</U>
distribution with the reference value makes-up <I>a reference axis
</I>(why it is called axis we shall see later on, when we will focus
on processes). Since an object generally has a set of distributed
attributes, each attribute from this set will have its own axis of
reference on the inner domain of the support attribute.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Definition
3.5.1:</B> The set of reference distributions for the model
attributes of an object makes-up an abstract object known as <B>the
inner reference system</B> of the object.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because we are dealing with an
invariant set of distributions on a common support, this means that
the inner reference system of an object is also an object itself
(obviously, an abstract one), which is called the <I>inner reference
object</I>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the approach way - either
virtual or realizable - the inner reference object may be a virtual
object, respectively, abstract realizable. In a virtual case (ideal,
mathematic), this object is made-up from a set of continuous even
distributions (with absolute accurate singular values), whereas in
case of the realizable reference, it is a set of evenly realizable
distributions with normal values, as reference values.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">It is worth
mentioning right even in this exposition stage that both the model of
a real object and its reference object are <I>abstract objects</I>
which exist only in the internal or external memory of an IPS (either
natural or artificial one), in us, in our mind of human beings, but
these make us able to perceive and evaluate our instant reality. This
subject shall be broadly approached in chapter 8 and 9.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The distributions
of the inner attributes against the inner reference values remain
invariant in case of an invariant object. These reference values may
be therefore considered as <I>common components</I> for a set of
values assigned on the object&rsquo;s inner domain (as it was
mentioned at the par.3.4). Since they are common components, any
variation in the value of these references is equally transmitted to
all the dependent values from that distribution, as we have already
noticed in case of the compound objects. In case of the objects&rsquo;
composition, each object is represented in the outside by its
reference object, the relations deployed between the objects which
are included in this composition are relations developed between the
inner reference objects belonging to these objects.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
3.5.1:  The reader will be able to better understand the truth and
generality of the above mentioned issues if an analogy with the
situation of relations between two objects belonging to the category
of the current existing world&rsquo;s states is being made. It is a
well-known fact that the political relations between two states are
actually relations developed by their governments, more precisely
between the ministries of foreign affairs belonging to these
governments. In other words, the government of a state is an inner
reference system of this object, against which both the inner
attributes of the state&rsquo;s components and the outer attributes,
revealed by the relations with other states, are determined. As for
the human relationships within a community, there is a particular
inner reference system for each individual  in the evaluation of his
conduct - that is the individual conscience - but there is also a
reference system which is external to the individual but internal to
the society - that is the moral conduct, ethics, good manners rules
etc. - which makes-up the reference system for the behavior of all
the society&rsquo;s members. The individual conscience of an element
of society, as an inner reference, is granted (through education)
with the proper values right from the set of conduct norms which is
the society&rsquo;s global reference.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

Because the <I>spatial position</I> attribute of a real object is
very important in this paper, we shall focus a little bit on the
reference object for this kind of attribute. We know since the
schooling years that in order to define the position of a point in
space, a system of reference made-up from three equally orthogonal
axes (in case of a 3D space) is required, and these axes have a
single intersection point- that is the system origin. According to
the objectual philosophy, the axes of reference are some independent
reference distributions which have only one element in common, which
is their intersection (origin, common component of the three axes).
This unique element for a certain object has a special denomination
in this paper - <I><B>T reference</B></I><B> </B>- because it is the
element of the inner reference system involved in the translation
processes (which shall be approached in the following chapter).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="R_ref"></A>
The other elements of the inner spatial reference system - the axes
of reference (more exactly, their <U>directions</U>, invariant along
their entire length) - make-up the second reference, that is <I><B>R
reference</B></I> (which is involved in the evaluation of the
object&rsquo;s rotation processes).</P>
