<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">3.6 Conclusions</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, what is an
object? According to the above-mentioned issues, it results that an
object can exist only for an IPS able to validate this existence, as
we are about to see later on. The purpose of this &ldquo;invention&rdquo;
which was initially specific only to NIPS is to separate
(distinguish, differentiate) a distribution of a property (which is
perceptible by that IPS), with a certain inner domain, against the
rest of the support domain on which the property is not distributed.
We have noticed that this can be achieved by means of the
differential attribute - that is <I>the contrast</I> - which is
different from zero only in case of a &ldquo;determinable&rdquo;
property difference. Therefore, an unevenness of the attribute
distribution which is found mostly at the boundary of the object
existence is the abstract support for the objects <I>distinguishability</I>.
The contrast (differential information), as the object&rsquo;s
essential attribute, requires however a special condition in case of
the realizable objects, which shall be approached later on in this
study, that is <U>their finiteness of the support domain</U> (both
towards zero and towards infinite).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">By analysing the
definition 3.1.3, we may notice that the superposition of the
distributions on the same support is equivalent with the association
of more objects (abstract) with a simultaneous existence in a single
one, this object being therefore qualitatively decomposable (an
internal decomposition), and the joining (adjacent-disjoint
concatenation) of the support domains of many objects can lead to a
formation by means of external composition of another object.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, another basic
quality of the objects seems to be obvious, that is their
<I>decomposability</I> up to the level of the elementary object
(imposed only by the existing and workable information amount, or by
the expiry of the object model) and their (outer, external)
<I>composability</I> up to the boundary of the possible domain of the
support attribute.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, another
basic quality of the objects, coming also from the definition 3.1.3,
is the <I>invariance</I> of their model properties (for certain
objects). Briefly, the object&rsquo;s basic attributes are: the
<I>invariance </I>as model, <I>de(composability)</I> and
<I>distinguishability</I>.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As I have already
mentioned above, all the objects properties are evaluated by a MS
belonging to IPS class, and their evaluation is made by comparison
with (against) a reference system (RS), and because RS can be either
<I>internal</I> or <I>external</I> to the object, these properties
can be also internal or external. It is very important to notice that
the outer properties of an object are assigned (associated) to the
object&rsquo;s inner RS, and this inner RS is the object involved in
the external relations (relations with the nearby objects).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">With all the
apologies given to those which might be offended, we have to make
clear a characteristic regarding the approach on the notion of <I>object</I>
in this paper, an approach which makes no difference between the
non-living (abiotic) objects and the biosystems, objects which are
considered as <I>creatures, beings,</I> and for which we should have
a special appreciation, according to certain dogma. Obviously, when
we shall deal with the models specific to the abiotic and biotic MS,
there will be clear differences, but as regards the general
(mathematic) object model, there is no difference. After reading
chapter 8, it will clearly result <U>that from the point of view of
the objects perception mode</U>, IPS makes no difference between the
biotic and abiotic objects.</P>
