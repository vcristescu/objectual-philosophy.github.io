<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Definition
3.2.1:</B> The most simple objects (non-decomposable) which comply
with the set of existence criteria P1&hellip;..P6 are called
<B>elementary objects</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">According to
criterion P1, the most simple object is the one which has a single
component among the set of distributed attributes. The support
attribute may be also multicomponent, multidimensional, such as the
3D Euclidean space, organized as a set of linear distributions with
independent directions (axes). As regards the criterion P2, the most
simple object is the one which is distributed on 1D support attribute
(with a single dimension). We have noticed in chapter 2 that the
distributions can be either simple or complex, and the most simple
primary distribution is the <I>uniform distribution</I>. Therefore,
as regards the criterion P3, the most simple object is the one who
has an evenly distributed attribute. The amount of the support domain
of an object may be either however big but finite, or however little
but not zero (for the realizable objects)<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>1</SUP></A>2.
The minor support domain for a realizable object, as we have also
seen in chapter 2, is the difference between two singular normal
adjacent values (successive), with its geometric equivalent - that is
a DP. The quanta DP of domain may be concatenated (jointed) in order
to make-up domains of any size. As for the criterion P4, the most
simple object is therefore the one which has a DP of 1D, that is an
element of realizable primary distribution with an unidimensional
support.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The inner reference
system of an object shall be made-up from a number of elements equal
to the dimensions of the support, and equal to the number of the
distributed attributes within a set. In case of an isolated object
(which does not have any relations with the outside), all these
reference values are equal to zero (absolute reference). In case of
the systemic set of objects which develop some relations between
themselves, there will also be an <U>inner reference system for the
set</U> (global) but which is external for the constitutive objects.
In this case, the inner references of the objects are assigned with
values against this common outer reference. This assignment process
occurs only for those attributes which are involved into the
relations between objects. As a conclusion, the most simple object
which complies with the criteria P1&hellip;&hellip;.P6 - <I>elementary
object</I> - is an element of primary realizable distribution. This
object is composable, either under the meaning of making-up some
objects with higher support domains, or by means of properties
combination (superposition), for the formation of multidimensional
objects.</P>

	Finiteness of the realizable object both towards zero and towards
	infinite is imposed by the necessity of contrast at the borderline,
	which is an essential attribute for considering an object as
	distinguishable, and also imposed by the related information amount
	which must be finite.</P>
