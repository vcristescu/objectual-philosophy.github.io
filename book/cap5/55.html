<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">5.5 Conclusions</H2>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fluxes are basically some
	complex distributions of the motion deployed by a set of objects, at
	first, spatial distributions (Euler-type, at a given <I>t</I>
	moment, an overall state of the flux at that moment), then, temporal
	distributions of the spatial ones. Briefly, we may say that these
	are spatial-temporal distributions of the above-mentioned motions.
	Just like in case of any other distribution, there will be at least
	one element of it, that is an uniform distribution. In case of the
	realizable fluxes, the spatial distribution element is represented
	by the <I>flux quantum </I>or by <I>the elementary flux</I>.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the intensity of a flux is
	determined against a steady reference surface, the two levels of the
	realizable fluxes quantification - <I>the flux quantum</I> and <I>the
	elementary flux</I> - refer both to the element type of this
	surface, and to its quantity (attribute stockpile) conveyed by the
	flux element.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since they are specific
	distributed processes, the fluxes are spatial distributions of SEP,
	namely, vectorial distributions (vector fields).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The elements of these vector
	fields are a special class of vectors - <I>the carrier vectors</I> -
	which represent a <U>transport SEP</U> of an elementary quantity
	from the amount meant for conveyance.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Among the most important
	attributes of the fluxes, there are few worth mentioning: <I>the</I>
	<I>closure degree </I>(null for the totally open fluxes), <I>the
	effective section </I>(invariant for the isotom fluxes), and the
	<I>coherency degree</I> (which is null in case of the totally
	stochastic fluxes).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the point of view of Euler
	distribution type which is specific to a certain flux, two major
	flux classes (as virtual models) may be considered: the <I>totally
	coherent</I> fluxes (with an even Euler distribution) and <I>totally
	stochastic</I> fluxes (with a totally chaotic Euler distribution).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Besides the very general
	classifications of the fluxes according to the virtual models, which
	have been already presented, the real fluxes can also be
	differentiated (distinguished) according to the type of the conveyed
	attribute, and in case of the same type of conveyed attribute,
	another fluxes differentiation may be operated, based on the carrier
	object type which conveys that particular attribute. For instance,
	in case of abiotic MS, an essential amount which is conveyed by all
	the fluxes is the energy. We shall see in chapter 7 that the energy
	attribute is transmissible and it has as many carrier types, as many
	forms of matter existence are (photons, electromagnetic waves,
	pressure waves, EP, NC, missiles, asteroids, galaxies and many
	more). The same situation with the information fluxes, where its
	carriers (ISS) are also very diverse.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, we must underline that
	the motion of an object means the motion of all its model
	attributes; if there is a complex object, this motion is transmitted
	(distributed) to all its components, therefore, the properties
	contained at deeper analytical levels shall be also moved, even if
	these properties are not transmissible. According to the objectual
	philosophy, a motion of an amount cannot be taken into account
	without the existence of some objects which are the support of that
	amount. For example, in case of the energy fluxes which were above
	mentioned, some objects which are the support of that property must
	exist <U>at any analytical level of the material systems
	organization</U>.</P>
