5.2.2 Systemic (objectual) flux model 
</H3>
<H4 CLASS="western">5.2.2.1 Overview</H4>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As for the flux&rsquo;s
systemic model, we must use the specific concepts of this approach,
as the definition 5.2.1 also states, we shall be dealing with a
<I>realizable</I> spatial <I>objects </I>distribution, and these
processes are subjected to a <I>collective and specific motion
process</I>. According to the objectual philosophy, the motion of an
object means the motion of its inner object&rsquo;s reference system,
against an outer object&rsquo;s reference (that is because the inner
reference system of the object represents the object within its
external relations). Any object is also decomposable up to the level
of an elementary object, the element of primary realizable
distribution, with a DP support, and according to the systemic
theory, this last object being meant to replace the virtual point
from the classic mathematic model.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The virtual point
(dimensionless) from 3D space characteristic for the classic
approach, which had to be &ldquo;surrounded&rdquo; by a volume
element, becomes the inner T<I> </I>reference of an elementary 3D
object with an invariant <I>dV </I>volume, at which the inner R
reference is associated, and this is made-up (in a Cartesian-type RS)
from three length elements <I>dx, dy, dz</I>, with the directions <B>X</B>,
<B>Y</B>, <B>Z</B> which are orthogonal one another. For the real
fluxes of some cumulative attributes, the most suitable selection of
the inner T reference position is the central one, that is in the
middle of the intervals <I>dx, dy, dz</I>, which is a position
associated to the circumstances described in the current specialized
references, with the &ldquo;surrounding&rdquo; of the T reference
point.</P>

5.2.2.1.1: As it is minutely presented in annex X.3, the definition
mode of the elementary objects is one of the major differences
between the objectual philosophy and the classic mathematics or
physics. If according to the classic approach, the volume, area or
length element is the result of a process (at limit) of a gradual
decrease towards zero of these elements, according to the objectual
approach (by means of realizable distributions) the elementary object
may be obtained by meeting a simple condition that the distribution
of the dependent attribute to be considered as <U>uniform</U> (even
for the most uneven areas of the distribution from which the element
belongs to) on its inner domain. It is true that the gradual decrease
towards zero fulfills the condition of the uniform distribution, but
this method (of extreme abstraction) has many inconveniences which
are coming from the fact that the informational restrictions imposed
by the realizability of both of the abstract processes and of IPS
which runs these processes are not taken into account. The gradual
decrease towards zero of the elementary interval cannot be used any
longer when the distribution support is a segment of the natural
numbers set. Besides the issue concerning the size of the elementary
objects, another main difference in the specific approach of this
paper consists in the compulsory presence, for each object, even
elementary one, of an inner reference system, that is a system which
represents the object in its external relations.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the motion process, the
relations deployed by an object involved in the flux both with the
external reference and with its neighbors (the objects from its
nearby proximity) are very important. If the spatial relations
between the flux&rsquo;s objects remain invariant, the object as a
whole will move as a solid body; if the relations are only partly or
non-invariant, the motion will be a fluid-type one, as we are about
to see next. Thus, a new and coherent way for the classification of
the media types seems to occur, depending on the RS spatial component
which is variable during the motion process, classification which
shall be depicted in the following chapter.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under the systemic flux model, the
elementary flux represents the motion of an <U>elementary object</U>
against the outer reference. The main condition which must be
fulfilled by any object is the invariance of its model properties
during its entire existence period; therefore, the object&rsquo;s
motion means the simultaneous motion of all its properties.
Reciprocally, any motion of a property, namely of its flux, means the
motion of some material objects to whom that particular attribute
belongs to. In other words, there cannot be a flux of an amount
without the existence of its material support (see annex X.13 for the
difference between the concepts of <I>material support</I> and<I>
abstract support</I>).
