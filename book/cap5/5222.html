5.2.2.2.1: <B>Attention!</B> In this paper, the term &ldquo;quantity&rdquo;
has a quite different meaning than the one used in the common
language, denoting the value of the quantitative attribute associated
to a qualitative property. According to the common language, the word
&ldquo;quantity&rdquo; refers to the cumulative attributes
(countable, integrable, extensive) on a certain domain, resulting a
total quantity. According to the objectual philosophy, the word
&ldquo;<I>stockpile</I>&rdquo; defines this total quantity. In case
of the non-cumulative attributes, (intensive, such as the
temperature, pressure, etc.) the word &ldquo;value&rdquo; or &ldquo;amount&rdquo;
is being used, a quantitative quanta <I>&epsilon;</I> being also
related to it, but it does not represent a stockpile, but only a
normal numerical value. As for the intensive attributes, there is
also a difference regarding the meaning of the word &ldquo;density&rdquo;
of the distribution element. While for the extensive attributes, the
density was a ratio between an elementary evenly distributed
<U>stockpile</U> and its elementary support interval, in case of the
intensive attributes, the density is only a ratio between an absolute
(in case of the primary distributions) or relative (in case of the
derived distributions) <U>value</U>, evenly distributed and the
elementary support interval. The reader is invited to accept the fact
that the concept of <I>quantity</I> in the objectual philosophy
refers to the existential, quantitative attribute of a qualitative
property, regardless if that property is cumulative or not. However,
the attention must be maintained on the integration reasoning; it may
exist a volume distribution of the temperature, but its integration
does make sense only if this attribute is converted into a cumulative
amount, such as the thermal energy quantity.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because within the achievable
distribution 5.2.2.2.1, the variables <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>
vary gradually rather than continuously, with the amount 
<IMG SRC="5222_html_1ae169a5.gif" NAME="Object195" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13>,
any interval of these variables shall contain a finite and integer
number of values such as <I>N</I><SUB><I>x</I></SUB>, <I>N</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB>,
<I>N</I><SUB><I>z</I></SUB> (see annex X.3.8), resulting also a
finite and integer number of volume quanta for any spatial domain of
the distribution of amount <I>M</I>. As it was mentioned in annex
X.3, the number of the elements belonging to the realizable primary
distribution 5.2.2.2.1 can be very high (but not infinite as in the
case of the virtual distributions), because 
<IMG SRC="5222_html_6a225299.gif" NAME="Object196" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=55 HEIGHT=21>
is usually very small (<IMG SRC="5222_html_1f892f92.gif" NAME="Object197" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=24>is
the number of bytes used for the display of a normal numerical
value). For reducing the information amount which must be processed
and for cutting-down the time required for this processing, in case
of the distributions realizable on AIPS, the volume which includes
the spatial distribution of amount <I>M</I> is divided not in 3D DP,
but into volume elements <I>dV</I> with the sizes <I>dx</I>, <I>dy</I>,
<I>dz</I>, which were selected so that the inner distribution of the
amount <I>M</I> with the density 
<IMG SRC="5222_html_m261eefb4.gif" NAME="Object198" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=24>can
be considered as even on this elementary unit.</P>

5.2.2.2.2: Besides the amount of the inner domain, another major
difference between the volume quanta and the volume element is
represented by the composition of the inner reference system of the
two elementary objects. In case of the volume element <I>dV</I>, we
have seen that it has both a T reference and a R reference made-up
from the directions <B>X</B>,<B>Y</B>,<B>Z</B> of the three segments
<I>dx</I>, <I>dy</I>, <I>dz</I>. In case of the volume quanta <I>q</I><SUB><I>V</I></SUB><SUB>,
</SUB>the inner reference is made-up only from T reference, the
rotations being totally non-determined for this kind of object, just
as in case of the dimensionless point.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

(only for a cumulative attribute):</P>

<IMG SRC="5222_html_57c94c69.gif" NAME="Object200" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=49 HEIGHT=24>
is the stockpile from the amount <I>M</I> assigned to the elementary
volume <I>dV,</I> placed on that spatial position.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Attention!</B> In this paper, both
the elementary volume and the volume quanta are <I>objects </I>with
an inner RS, and T reference (origin) of this inner RS is the one who
has assigned the position 
<IMG SRC="5222_html_m793525fd.gif" NAME="Object201" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=72 HEIGHT=24>,
defined against the inner RS of the distribution (as compound
object), and inner distribution&rsquo;s RS position is defined
against an outer RS (an absolute one). According to the relations
5.2.2.2.1 and 5.2.2.2.2, the position vector 
<IMG SRC="5222_html_3bfeabab.gif" NAME="Object202" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=24>
of each element is defined against this inner RS of the distribution
(with its components T and R). When the distribution starts to move
against an outer reference (for instance, an absolute reference), the
variable attribute shall be 
<IMG SRC="5222_html_m3ff9b052.gif" NAME="Object203" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=24>,
the position vector of the inner T reference of the distribution,
against the outer T reference, and once with it,  the positions of
all the distribution elements shall become variable. If there are
S-type relations (which shall be defined in the following chapter)
deployed between the distribution elements, an overall motion of the
inner R reference against the outer R reference may also occur.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The relation
5.2.2.2.2 is identical <U>from the point of view of its form</U> with
the relations from the current scientific papers depicting spatial
distributions of some amounts, (and in which the expression with
&ldquo;surrounded&rdquo; point by the volume element is being used),
but its meaning is the above-mentioned one. The distribution
5.2.2.2.2 is also a primary spatial distribution of the amount <I>M</I>,
but with a higher approximation degree and requiring a less calculus
volume as compared to the distribution 5.2.2.2.1.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">At the moment when
the distribution of the amount <I>M </I>which was initially static,

of the inner <I>T </I>reference of the distribution becomes variable
and once with it, the positions of each distribution element become
variable as well. All of these variations are <I>time </I>dependent.</P>
