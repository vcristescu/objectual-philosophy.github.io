<H4 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">5.2.2.3 Flux&rsquo;s
objectual model</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the previous section, we have
asserted that the essence of the objectual approach consists in the
organization of the information about a specific phenomenon in
<I>objects </I>and <I>processes</I>. In case of the distribution
5.2.2.2.1 or 5.2.2.2.2, the existence criteria of an object
(established in chapter 3) are:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	P1	the set of assigned attributes
contains a single attribute <I>M</I>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	P2	the support attribute of the
distribution is the spatial position 
<IMG SRC="5223_html_6c554770.gif" NAME="Object207" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=24>;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	P3	the distribution type is provided
by the relations 5.2.2.2.1 or 5.2.2.2.2, specific to a certain type
of spatial distribution;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	P4	the amount of the support domain is
the volume <I>V</I> (divided into the finite set of the quanta or of
the volume elements) in which amount <I>M</I> is distributed;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	P5	the inner reference system of the
complex object - <I>spatial distribution of the amount M</I>;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	P6	<I>t</I><SUB><I>k </I></SUB>moment
(a temporal DP) of the simultaneous existence of all the model
properties P1&hellip;P5.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The
properties P1&hellip;P4 have been explicitly settled by means of the
initial data, which were the same, both for the virtual flux model
and for the systemic one. However, the criterion P5 is specific for
the objectual approach, therefore, it will be minutely analyzed.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">In
chapter 3, we have seen what does the object mean, what does the
complex object mean and most of all, that the abstract object which
is the <I>inner reference</I> of the objects with spatial support has
two components: T reference and R reference. We have also noticed
that the motion of an object is represented by the motion of its
inner reference system against an outer reference. Hence, two types
of <I>specific motions</I> have resulted and they are directly
related to the element of the inner reference system whose
quantitative attribute changes during the motion. If the position of
the inner T<I> </I>reference is the only one who changes, we are
dealing with a specific <I>translation</I> (displacement) process,
and if only the position of the inner R reference is variable, we are
dealing with a specific <I>rotation</I> process. As for the motions
deployed in a 3D Euclidean space (Cartesian coordinates), each of
these two motion types has three components, specific to each axis:
<I>T</I><SUB><I>x</I></SUB>, <I>T</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB>, <I>T</I><SUB><I>z</I></SUB>,
respectively <I>R</I><SUB><I>x</I></SUB>, <I>R</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB>,
<I>R</I><SUB><I>z</I></SUB>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We have also seen in chapter 3 that a
complex object has an inner RS, which is however external to all the
elements from which the object is made-up. As compared to this common
RS, the inner reference systems of the constitutive objects can be
involved in three types of relations:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>S-type relations</I>
	<I>-</I> If the relations between the inner T and R references of
	the constitutive objects are invariant during the motion, both
	between the neighbouring objects and against the homologue common T
	and R reference, the entire distribution of the amount <I>M </I>shall
	move just as a solid (rigid) body. In this case, there is a global
	(common) T and R reference of the distribution 5.2.2.2.1 or
	5.2.2.2.2, with their positions defined against an outer RS, against
	which the overall motion of the spatial distribution of amount <I>M</I>
	would be determined.  One may notice that within S-type relations,
	the inner motions of the complex object&rsquo;s elements, either T
	or R are forbidden.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>L-type relations</I>
	- If only the relations between the inner T<I> </I>references of the
	<U>neighbouring elements</U> are maintained invariant (the elements
	remain adjacent, permanently in contact during the motion but they
	are able to rotate freely), the entire distribution shall be moving
	just as a finite liquid portion which preserve its volume but it is
	not able to preserve its shape (inner distribution of the
	elements&rsquo;spatial position).	.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.2in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
5.2.2.3.1: The volume preservation is made just because the inner
spatial domains of  the constitutive objects remain permanently
adjacent. In this way, if the number of elements is constant, even
the sum of the domains amount (total volume) will also remain
constant.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this case, there is only one common
T reference (the mass-center for a liquid portion) whose motion
against an outer T reference is the overall motion of the complex
object. As regards L-type of relations, both the inner translations
and rotations are allowed, either on the element level or on the
group of elements (cluster), but these motions <U>are interrelated</U>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.2in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
5.2.2.3.2: The translation motions of the elements which are in
permanent contact are the same with the translation motion of the
center of a spherical body which rolls without sliding on a surface.
In this case, the shifting motion of the inner T reference of the
body is exclusively generated by  its rotation (rolling), otherwise
speaking, if there is no rotation, there is no shifting, and other
way round, any shifting must compulsorily come with a rotation.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<OL START=3>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>G-type relations</I>
	- If there is no invariant relation between the inner T and R
	references of the components and the common T and R reference of the
	distribution, those particular elements do not make-up a compound
	object any longer, each of these elements moving freely, just as the
	molecules of a gas. In case of G-type relations, any kind of inner
	motion is allowed and there is no interrelation between the T and R
	motions.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"> The flux model is
different for each of the above-mentioned cases, but they all have in
common the fact that we are dealing with a distributed motion, first
spatially and then temporally, that is a spatial-temporal motion
distribution.</P>
