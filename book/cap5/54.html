<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As we have
previously noticed, an amount <I>M</I> placed in a certain area of
the space, in a known volume <I>V</I>, limited by a closed area &Sigma;,
can be described by means of a spatial distribution of this amount on
volume <I>V</I>. The total quantity of attribute <I>M</I> distributed
in a spatial domain with volume <I>V</I>, limited by a closed area &Sigma;
is the attribute <I>stockpile M</I> inside that volume. <B>Attention!
</B>In the chapter which was focused on distributions, we made the
statement that the stockpile definition is valid only for the
cumulative, extensive attributes (for which the addition and
integration of the values assigned on the distribution&rsquo;s
elements is possible).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">If the distribution
refers to scalar, time invariant quantities (such as the mass density
of a motionless body), we might say that the amount <I>M</I> is
statically stored in that particular volume (such as the raw stocks,
goods stored in warehouses, etc.). On the contrary, if the amount <I>M</I>
is characterized by a distribution of some vectorial quantities (such
as, for instance, a closed flux), then, it might be said that we are
dealing with a dynamic stockage (for example, the quadergy from the
electric circuits, kinetic energy charged in fliers, superconductor
magnets, stockage rings of the accelerated particles, but also the
blood stock of the live animals or the sap stock of the plants etc.).</P>

5.4.1: There is always an analytical decomposition level of the
stockage type, at which a stockage which is apparently static, it
proves to be in fact purely dynamic. For example, a parameter such as
the pressure which is scalar by definition, but when it is subjected
to microscopic analysis, it proves to be generated by the motion of
molecules and by their collision with the walls and with each other,
in fact, due to some corpuscular fluxes, (vector fields), open at the
molecular level, but closed at the macroscopic level, confined within
the limits of the medium characterized by that particular pressure.
Basically, any atom consists of an amount of inner EP fluxes, which
in their turn&hellip;  After the complete reading of this paper, the
reader will understand that actually, there is no static stockage in
the real world, but only a scalarisation of some purely dynamic
processes (see annex X.9).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

at the surface &Sigma;, inward-oriented (vice versa as compared to
the conventions from mathematics), the inward-oriented fluxes shall
lead to a stockpile increase (the dot product from the relation
5.2.1.4 shall be positive). Obviously, the fluxes which convey the
amount <I>M</I> with the overall direction oriented to the outside
shall lead to an inner stockpile decrease.</P>

5.4.2: The aforementioned assertions are not and they cannot be valid
in case of the virtual surfaces from mathematics, because the
stockage of a flux is not possible inside them, due to their total
permeability. The reader will better understand the stockage issue
after reading the following chapters, in which we are dealing with
bounding surfaces which are partly permeable or even impermeable for
fluxes, and consequently, able to store a stockpile inside.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
