Non-determination and information</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">In case of an
attribute belonging to a real object, with a limited range of values
of its existential attribute, an experiment is possible to be
performed at a certain moment which would result in the determination
of the attribute value, more precisely, out of the finite set of
values, one is selected as a real value (the so-called realized value
which is obviously valid at the moment of determination).</P>

9.6.1: The <I>attribute&rsquo;s quantitative value</I> must be
understood under the meaning of the present paper, in other words, as
a finite difference against an invariant benchmark (reference), value
which is permanently associated to a non-determination interval (in
this case, as we will see next, this interval is  <FONT FACE="Symbol, serif"><I>&#61508;</I></FONT><I>V</I><SUB><I>R</I></SUB>).
This is an essential specification because according to the objectual
philosophy and as we have pointed out so far, there are two types of
numerical values: <I>absolute accurate values</I> (AAV) with a null
non-determination interval, therefore, they contain an infinite
information amount (both material and abstract unachievable) and
<I>normal values</I>, made-up from a relative accurate value (RAV)
which is associated to a non-determination interval (truncation,
approximation). The AAV, virtual objects, are the ones which form the
axis of the real numbers from the mathematics.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Let us admit that
before the experiment initiation, our knowledge regarding the
attribute value was zero, and after the experiment completion, it is
different from zero. By also assuming that the number of possible
values (equiprobable as well) of the domain is a finite one, and they
were all not achieved before the experiment, the non-determination is
therefore total and the information is null. As their name suggests,
the non-determination and determination are complementary (having the
absolute reality as a basis of complementariness).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The total
non-determination which is related to the null information, is the
absolute reference against which the cognition (information amount)
acquired <U>by means of the experiment</U> may be determined. The
information amount (the information&rsquo;s existential attribute)
obtained as a result of an experiment, through which an initial
domain of possible values 
<IMG SRC="96_html_m2520c4c0.gif" NAME="Object489" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=24>
is reduced at a smaller final domain <I>

it is given by the following relation:</P>

(9.6.1)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and the measuring unit of this
attribute is the information amount which is obtained as a result of
the determination (also, through an experiment) on the realization of
an event from two equiprobables (restrain of the values domain at
half from the initial value). For such case, the relation 9.6.1
provides:</P>

9.6.2: Most of the bio-systems which own a visual perception system
have two exemplars belonging to this system type (the eyes) which are
symmetrically placed against a vertical plane which runs through the
antero-posterior axis (one of the elements of the internal reference
system), plane which divides the whole visible space in two semi
infinite spaces (left and right). If the bio-system is able to
perceive an object, its first location is established in one of these
semi infinite spaces, fact which provides to the bio-system&rsquo;s
IPS one information bit and then, the location into up-down and 
front-back semi infinite spaces, which adds two more bits. The rest
of the determination process of the object&rsquo;s position (rest of
the information bits) is now provided by the animal eye which is able
of a more accurate separation of the object&rsquo;s position, which
this time is against the eye&rsquo;s internal reference system. This
internal reference system of the visual organ is also based on a
splitting of the sensitive elements area in two domains (left-right
and up-down but against the eye&rsquo;s internal reference system),
splitting which allows the differential control of the muscles of the
eye, head and even of the animal torso for watching the movements of
the monitored objects. Other additional information concerning the
position of an external object is provided by the other sense organs
of the animal IPS (the proprioceptive, auditory, olfactory system
etc.).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As we have previously mentioned, the
information amount is the existential attribute of the abstract
object - <I>information.</I> The information is an abstract object
with a high abstraction level, and according to the classic
philosophical terminology, it belongs to the class of <I>categories</I>
(although it has a higher abstraction level as compared to any of
them). This extremely high abstraction level makes that the
information definition by means of the classic method (proximate kind
+ specific difference) to not be used, the information lacking a
proximate kind (the proximate kind is an abstract object with an
abstraction level higher or lower than the defined object).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the objectual philosophy makes
some specifications on this notion:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If each <I>material system</I> is
	an existence form of the <I>matter</I>, all these forms (material
	objects) having the same generic model (fluxes triad model), we may
	state that each <I>abstract system</I> is a form of the <I>information</I>
	existence, which is also related to a generic model (the generic
	object model which reflects the total amount of properties
	associated to an ISS by an IPS).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the total amount of MS and
	processes in which they are involved makes-up the <I>real world</I>
	(reality, material world), the total amount of abstract systems
	forms the <I>abstract world</I> (valid only for the IPS class, with
	sizes which depend on their performance level).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the real world has an existence
	which is independent from the IPS existence, and it is unique, the
	abstract world is strictly connected to a specific IPS and through
	the internal ISS, each IPS has its own representation of the real
	world which is able to perceive it (image of the accessible known
	reality). An IPS is able to perceive few from the attributes of an
	external object (external for IPS). The total amount of these
	properties, each of them with a non-zero existential attribute which
	are perceived in parallel (therefore, simultaneously) on a single
	temporal DP, makes-up the <I><B>information</B></I> <I>associated</I>
	(by IPS) to that particular <I>object</I>, at that temporal DP.
	Thus, the abstract object named <I>state</I> of an object is nothing
	else but this information associated by IPS to a perceivable object.
	The information amount which is contained in each perceivable
	attribute is as high as its value has a less non-determination
	degree (as long as this value is more invariant, more accurate).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Non-determination of an amount
	from a specific interval also means that that value is <U>variable</U>
	inside the interval, either by means of known or unknown variation
	laws, but if there are invariant attributes distributed on that
	interval, these attributes represent an information which is
	associated to the variation (to the process)<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>8</SUP></A>3.
	The information is provided to IPS at the moment when an experiment
	which allows the evaluation of the attribute&rsquo;s value, with a
	non-determination less than the one prior to the experiment
	unfolding. We are noticing that the probability and the
	probabilities calculus do not provide to IPS a larger information
	amount than the one which is used as a base for the probabilities
	calculus, because this calculus does not restrain the
	non-determination. The increase of the information amount stored
	into IPS memory is mostly achieved as a result of an experiment (the
	realization of the probable event).</P>

9.6.3: There is another way for the growth of the information amount
contained into the memory of an IPS, that is the determination of
some invariant relations between the experimental data (so-called
invariant laws between the values of the attributes which belong to
the real objects). We have seen that these invariant relations (the
classic continuous functions) include (if they are true as well) a
quasi-infinite amount of information, being devoted on the
substitution of a very large number of individual assignment
relations. However, these laws can be reached only as a result of a
previous existence (and processing) of a large amount of experimental
data (concrete values of the attributes which will form the support
of the future law).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The existence of some restrictions
	(limitations, constraints) on the value of an amount is equivalent
	with the existence of some attributes determinism (cognition,
	invariance, domain limitation) &ndash; of having the values within a
	specific range. By contrast, the permission, freedom correspond to
	the non-determination which means zero information in case it is
	total.

9.6.4: In case of S-type distributed MS which enforce restrictions to
their elements both as regards the translation and rotation, the
invariant mean values of the elements position represent an internal
information, whereas the vibration of elements (both of the
translation and rotation ones) represents the non-determination
domain of these positions.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	As we have pointed out many times within the paper herein, if the
	spatial position of a body is variable, an information about this
	attribute cannot exist (because it is not invariant), but if the
