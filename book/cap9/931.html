<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">9.3.1 The name</H3>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The social being
status, that is the status of a member belonging to a form of social
organization, requires by all means a form of communication between
one individual and another (or others) from the group. The pressure
imposed by the need to communicate has determined the mankind to
discover the <I>external</I> <I>abstract objects</I> which were the
<I>representatives</I> of some internal abstract objects, whose
intensive utilization has led to the differentiation of humans from
the rest of the animals. In case of the human spoken language, the
abstract objects considered as external representatives consist in a
short sequence of elementary sounds (phonemes), produced by the brain
owner which wants to communicate and who has just recalled a certain
object; in other words, it is a low-sized substitute (with a low
syntactic value) for an internal semantic information heap. The
above-mentioned phoneme sequence, an abstract object which is an
<U>external representation</U> of an <U>internal abstract object</U>
is the object&rsquo;s <I>name</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: #f2f2f2; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.01in 0.06in"><A NAME="name"></A>
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Definition
9.3.1.1:</B> An <U>external</U> ISS with an invariant syntactic value
(literal or phonetic), which represents a certain <U>internal</U>
abstract object found in the memory of an IPS constitute the <B>name</B>
of that internal abstract object.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The name structure,
that is the spatial and/or temporal arrangement of its elements
(phonemes or letters) represents its <I>syntactic value</I>. The
total amount of the information contained into the internal abstract
object (which exists into IPS memory) associated to that name,
represents the <I>semantic value</I> of that name.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.2in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
9.3.1.1: The fact that the semantic value associated to a specific
name is given by the amount of internal information which is found in
the memory of an IPS, has deep implications regarding the
communication between different IPS by means of the external
languages. Even if, structurally speaking, more IPS are identical,
the information amount which is associated by them to a certain name
is different and in proportion to their previous specific experience
and to the cognition level. This fact, as we are about to see
further, has major implications on the amount of the information
communicated by means of external languages.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The same method is
also used for the processual objects, each process type which may be
found at an object with a certain <I>object_name</I> is related to a
<I>process_name</I>. According to the human natural language, the
<I>object_name</I> are the nouns with all their flectional forms, and
the <I>process_name</I> are the verbs with their flectional forms as
well. Because the perception systems are similar at all the community
members (the small differences are not relevant), a possible receiver
of the spoken or written message would be able to recall the same
object and the same process as a result of the perception and
understanding of that message. The compulsory conditions which are
required in order to accomplish this communication process are the
following ones:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the participants at the
	communication process must belong to the same species of
	bio-systems, which means that they must have the same type of IPS,
	the same sensory organs and the internal sensorial representations
	of the same external objects and processes must be identical;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the participants involved in
	communication must have previously perceived both the objects and
	the processes contained in the message (namely, the abstract objects
	related to each <I>object_name </I>and <I>process_name</I> must be
	already stored into the participants&rsquo;memory);</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sequence of phonemes or
	graphical symbols must be always the same for the same substituted
	abstract object, which means that a strict correspondence must be
	established between the set of syntactic values and the set of the
	represented objects (semantic values);</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the participants at the
	communication process must have in their minds the association
	between abstract internal object, with the specific phonemes or
	symbols sequence, so that when this message is perceived, the
	colligate recall may take place (in other words, all the
	participants involved in the communication must know the same
	language).</P>
