attributes<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>7</SUP></A>2.
These <I>n</I> properties are distributed (in case of the material
objects) on a <I>spatial domain</I> occupied by the object, domain
which represents the abstract support of all <I>n</I> distributions
assigned on this internal domain. Therefore, the general property P2
(the common support attribute of all distributions) is the spatial
position, and the sizes of the object&rsquo;s internal spatial domain
represents the property P4. The general property P3 (distribution
type of each property within the set) is assessed by the input unit
of IPS which is specialized in receiving that property. The
assessment of P3 distributions is made both against the internal RS
of IPS (the general property P5 of IPS) and against the internal RS
of the object <I>Obx</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB> (the general P5 property
of that particular object), internal RS of IPS being the external

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">It is worth
mentioning that the property P6 is an internal property of IPS, and
that property is assigned to its internal representation from the
internal ISS medium of IPS (a <I>state</I> of the external object
which is found at the moment <I>t</I> into the memory IPS). In other
words, all the general properties about which we have discussed so
far, belong (are related) to this internal representation of an
external object, representation which has the form of a specific
structure (configuration) of the internal ISS.</P>

9.2.2.1: A <I>concrete abstract object</I> is the information
contained in an internal ISS of an IPS, corresponding to the
perception of an object from the direct individual reality (an
external one, for instance) by an input unit. This object (internal
ISS) has a finite exclusively spatial distribution (which, in case of
an AIPS, is related to a continuous domain of memory locations), all
the other external distributions (either frequential or temporal)
being converted into spatial distributions. ISS which contains a
concrete abstract object is stored (in case of NIPS) into the
short-term memory (STM). Any real object perceived by an IPS has a
<I>representation</I> (a substitute, an image) inside it (of IPS),
namely, an internal ISS which must contain the information associated
to the real object. However, not any abstract object (that is the
information contained in an ISS) has a correspondent in the real
world. For example, the abstract objects which are generated as a
result of the information processing operations (which are abstract
processes) do not always have a potential correspondent in the real
world (which means that they are not materially realisable). The most
relevant and simple example is represented by ISS which contains the
result of the comparison between two real objects (difference,
contrast). This abstract object cannot be related to any object from
the real world. Adjoining to the possibility of representing a
specific real object, an abstract object may also represent a set of
real or abstract objects. The <I>names, resultants</I>, <I>public
authority, etc.</I> are few worth-mentioning elements belonging to
this category and some of them will be subsequently analysed.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The association of a concrete abstract
object (a finite amount of internal sensorial information) to an
external material object is the first step, the main stage of the
<I>abstraction </I>process. Due to this reason, the sensorial
abstract objects have the lowest abstraction level from the internal
abstract objects, being <I>fundamental abstract objects</I> (with an
unit abstraction level).</P>

9.2.2.2: Attention! When we have dealt with the analytical level of
the compound objects in chapter 3, we saw that the objects which
cannot be decomposed any longer <U>based on a certain criterion </U>show
an unit analytical level, which means that they are fundamental (or
elementary) objects <U>as regards that criterion</U>. When we are
