9.1.1: The validation of an object&rsquo;s presence at a specific
spatial position can be done only by an IPS. At the &ldquo;present&rdquo;
time of perception <I>t</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB><SUB> </SUB>(time which
is also defined in the same IPS), the external object is associated
to an internal ISS - that is the internal representation of the
external object. Other ISS associations will follow afterwards, which
are either representations of the same object (but at a subsequent
&ldquo;present&rdquo; time) or of other objects, but ISS associated
to an object at the <I>t</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB><SUB> </SUB>moment
does not represent a real object any longer, because it is already
stored into IPS memory (it belongs to the past). According to our
terminology, we might say that an ISS associated to the perceiving
real object is a representation of the <I>state</I> of the existing
external object. We have already discussed in the previous chapter
about the <I>present interval</I> required to IPS in order to define
the processes (because a process needs a temporal interval for its
unfolding). We might say that the succession of the states specific
to a real object makes-up a real process. But the temporal states and
moments associated to an object which is declared as real, is
internal ISS, specific to a certain type of IPS, and if that IPS is
singular, all of these will be valid only for it. In the previous
chapter, we have noticed that the principle of the objects existence
implies that the object which is considered as existent, to emit
perceivable fluxes or to reflect them (to withstand against the
intrusion of the external fluxes). The reader is invited to remember
a fact which is quite frequent in the people&rsquo;s world, namely,
the checking of his own existence in circumstances in which he is put
in doubt by the brain, such as the transition from the dream to the
wake state. In such circumstances, for checking if the dream keeps
going or what is happening is a real process, any human being
palpates himself or the surrounding objects. But, these activities
are nothing else but materiality (reality) tests carried out on our
own body or on the surrounding objects, which certifies that, under
successful conditions, either our epidermis (our own RBS) or the
surrounding objects (with their own RBS) are not permeable to the
flux of the moving fingers. Besides the confirmation of our own
materiality, as well as of the materiality of the surrounding
objects, this test also confirm the existence of the information
processing processes deployed in our brain, therefore, of the
conscious state (wake state) <I>Cogito ergo sum</I>, don&rsquo;t you
think so? (#)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="dir_conc_real"></A>
According to the theoretical models upheld in this paper, the class
of the real objects is formed entirely from <I>material </I>objects
defined in accordance to the class model of the material systems (3<B>F</B>
model). The union of all the real objects perceived by <U>a certain
IPS</U> as having a simultaneous and permanent existence in a certain
period of time, together with the union of all the real processes to
which they are subjected to, makes-up the <I><B>direct </B></I>(synonym
- <I><B>concrete</B></I>)<I><B> individual</B></I> <I><B>reality</B></I>
<U>existent</U> at that present interval <U>for that particular IPS</U>.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="dir_coll_real"></A>
If more identical IPS exist, which perceive the same real objects and
processes, and these IPS are able to communicate externally their
perceptions (internal representations), then, the objects and
processes which are <U>jointly</U> perceived by IPS set shall make-up
the <I><B>direct collective reality</B></I> of IPS group.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="known_real"></A>
According as the communication means between IPS have an access range
which exceeds the direct perception domain of an IPS, each IPS shall
be able to access informations (obviously, external ones) about the
existence of some objects and processes assumed to be real, which
have been perceived by other IPS placed at long distances and
collected (stored) for long periods of time. The union of these
representations of objects and processes <U>assumed to have a
permanent and simultaneous existence</U> shall make-up the <I><B>known
reality</B></I> of the IPS group (society). This known reality is
therefore made-up from the material objects and processes about which
reliable data are found, taken either from its own IPS information
stockpile (long-term memory), or from the community&rsquo;s access
data base (books, magazines and other broadcast mass-media or
external information storage media).</P>

9.1.2: Now it is time to make the reader aware that the information
which is taken into account in case of the different reality
categories must meet a basic condition: <U>to be true</U>. While as
regards the truth value of the information acquired during the
perception process of the direct individual reality, there are few
reasons of doubt (only concerning the illusions which can be avoided
due to a proper education and experience level), as for the known
reality, there are little chances that the entire information amount
to be true.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="abs_real"></A>As we have
aforementioned, the known reality is an information union on the
objects and processes which are presumed as permanently real by a
certain IPS community (such as the community of brains existing in a
specific human society at a given moment). Because this IPS set is
able to perceive only the information received through the currently
perceptible fluxes (this category also consisting in the fluxes
perceived through artificial conversion means of the fluxes unable to
be directly perceived), there are certainly material objects and
processes unable to be perceived yet by this community, therefore,
there is no information about the existence of these objects and
processes. This means that, besides the elements of the known
reality, there are also a lot of material objects and processes
belonging to a potentially concrete reality, but yet unknown. The
union of all these known and unknown objects, but which are presumed
as having a simultaneous existence in the entire infinite space,
makes-up the <I><B>absolute reality</B></I>.</P>

9.13: This abstract object called <I>absolute reality </I>may be

9.1.4: Such examples of some <U>infinite-performing</U> IPS conceived
by people for ages are the deities which form the basis of the past
or current religions. These deities are all-knowing, they know all
about any person, creature and thing on the planet, at any moment
from their existence; they have created the stars, planets and other
astronomical bodies, people and all the plants, animals, therefore,
all of these objects and creatures initially existed as a project
(concepts, abstract objects) in the mind of these deities. The reader
may decide by his own if this kind of infinite-performing systems are
materially realizable.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The absolute
reality is a virtual object towards which any type of cognition
asymptotically tends to, including the human cognition, but which can
never be reached. This virtual object is however useful for another
global definition of the <I>information</I> concept, the absolute
reality being the base for a dichotomous classification, of defining
a complementarity (see the annex X.5), namely, between the <I>cognition</I>
(determination, information existence) regarding the known segment of
the absolute reality and <I>non-cognition</I> (non-determination,
lack of information), such a wide but yet unknown field of the
absolute reality. The absolute reality at a certain moment includes
the total amount of the states of the material objects and of their

9.1.5: As we have previously mentioned, very small but constantly
growing domains from this absolute reality become accessible to our
cognition, making-up the <U>true</U> known reality. We certainly know
that in the range of abiotic MS, there are the terrestrial natural
media (solids, liquids, gases), we know most of their macro and
microscopic properties and we know how to build artificial objects by
using them. We also know that beside our planet, there are other
planets in our solar system, we saw them at close distance by means
of the spatial probes and we are now finding that there are also
planets around other stars. We also know that there are galaxies and
systems made-up from galaxies which are spread up to the limit of our
observable universe. In the field of biotic MS, we have certain
knowledge regarding their structure by starting with the prokaryotic
cells and ending with the biggest plants and animals. We know that
all the bio-systems are based on the genetic code contained in the
DNA molecule. These are only few benchmarks from the much more wider
field of the known reality which is true and accessible to people
nowadays. All these certain knowledge are obtained based on the fact
that these particular systems are accessible to a great number of
people, either directly, through our sensory perception systems, or
indirectly, through auxiliary means (microscopes, telescopes etc.)
which were constantly checked proving that they are reliable. The
doubts regarding the true about some data from the currently known
reality occur when those data refer to the material systems which are
inaccessible to the direct or instrumental observation, either due to
too small sizes for the current instruments, or due to the
environment conditions which do not allow the existence of any
instrument (that is the case of the internal media of AB), or because
of too long distances. In such circumstances, the lack of real
information is compensated by synthetic, hypothetic information
&ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; by theorists, based on some mathematic
models. However, a mathematic model is an abstract object placed in
the external or internal memory of an IPS, and as any other abstract
object generated as a result of an information processing system, it
is not compulsory to be materially realizable, namely, to exist a
correspondent MS. The neutral hydrogen atoms from our universe which
can be found at a specific moment, considered as components of the
absolute reality, have the same structure and spectral lines of
emission/absorption for several billion years, without even care that
the people have released at least tens of mathematic models for them
over the years. In other words, despite of the different models, the
structure and the internal processes from all the hydrogen atoms are
unique, regardless of the human cognition. This oneness which is
valid for a group of MS can be extrapolated to the set of all MS
which make-up the absolute reality. As we have mentioned in chapter
1, regardless of the reality models imposed at a specific moment by
some interest groups, the material systems which are beyond the
limits of human cognition continue to live on, just as the galaxies,
electrons or photons which existed back since our ancestors times,
but nobody told them that (#).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
