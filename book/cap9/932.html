<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">9.3.2 Language
and communication</H3>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The basic role of
an external language is to structure (organize) a finite amount of
semantic information which is meant to be transmitted from an IPS to
another, in order to mediate the communication process. However, we
have seen that a transfer of an amount from one location to another
is considered as a <I>flux</I>, the language is therefore, nothing
else but an organization form of an information flux (IF). Since we
are talking about a flux, we must establish right from the start,
what its source is (emitter IPS) and what its destination is, namely,
a receiver IPS. The semantic structure of an IF<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>7</SUP></A>5
issued by the objectual philosophy is made-up from the following
fundamental classes of abstract components:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Objects,</I> represented in the
	natural language by the <I>object_name</I> (nouns) and their
	substitutes (for example, the pronouns), with all their flectional
	forms;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Processes</I>, represented by
	the <I>process_name</I> (verbs), with their flectional forms as
	well;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Determinants,</I> which
	includes all the other syntactic components of the language
	(adjectives, numerals, articles, conjunctions, prepositions etc.);
	the role of these determinants is even to increase the determination
	degree (information amount) of the objects and processes contained
	into IF (the sent message).</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The objects,
processes and a part of the determinants are represented by <I>names,</I>
and so as we have found out in the previous section, there are
external abstract objects with a low syntactic value, which
substitute (represent) semantic information heaps. In this way, large
semantic information amounts can be sent through a low-intensity
information flux (which effectively carries only the syntactic
information).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The most simple
information system with a complete semantic and context-free value
meant to be sent to an addressee, which is made-up from objects
belonging to the three fundamental classes, is the <I>sentence</I>.
The compulsory elements (minimal) of a sentence are an <I>object_name</I>
(subject, a noun or its substitute) and a <I>process_name</I>
(predicate, a verb).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">In chapter 7 we
have seen what are the meanings of the <I>action, interaction </I>and
what are the objects involved in these processes - <I>agent object</I>
and <I>driven object</I> - even when we are dealing with the
informational action or interaction. When a message exchange (IF)
takes place between two or more IPS, it is clear that these fluxes
are able to produce actions (on the flux&rsquo;s IPS receiver), if
that IPS is permeable to the syntactic and semantic value of the
message, namely, the receiver IPS perceives ISS (the constitutive
objects of the incident IF) and accurately understands their
associated semantic content (it knows the language and is able to
recall the message&rsquo;s semantic value).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">By using the
specific terms of this paper, the IF agent source is the agent
object, that is the message emitter; the IF addressee is the
information-driven object, whose state (first an internal and then,
an external state) shall be modified as a result of the IF action.
According to the natural language, this transmitting process of a
semantic information amount between two or more IPS is named
<I>communication.</I> One may distinguish two types of communication:
unilateral (carried out in one way, from the emitter to the receiver,
that is an information <I>action</I> process), and bilateral
communication (carried out in both ways, that is an information
<I>interaction</I> process).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The message content
(its semantic value) is also focused on objects and processes, both
the agent and driven objects being found in this case, that is,
actions and interactions. However, a line must be clearly drawn
between the objects and the processes involved in the communication
process and the objects and processes involved (contained) in the
submitted message.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The objects which
are part of the communication are only the issuer (or issuers) and
the addressee (or the addressees), whereas the objects involved in
the message content are much more varied. Also, the unique external
process of IPS involved in communication is the information
transfer<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym" SDFIXED><SUP>7</SUP></A>6
(flux), whereas the processes included into the message are far more
varied. Another significant property of the objects and processes
involved in communication is the fact that they are real (also known
as real-time unfolded), and the objects and processes from the
message are clearly abstract and they are comprised in ISS which
represents the information flux.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Within the natural
language, the specification of one or more emitters (for instance, a
chorus or an organization), of one or more addressees, is made by
using either the singular or the plural. The emitter or the emitters
are included in the first person category (singular and plural) and
the addressee or the addressees are included in the second person
category.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
9.3.2.1: If the reader reminds what it was depicted in chapter 3,
namely that the singular object and the set of objects cannot be
mixed up in the present paper (the void set or the single-element set
are not allowed when we are dealing with objects), now, he will
probably better understand the reason for this restriction, because
the singular cannot be mistaken with the plural either within the
natural language. According to the objectual philosophy, the concept
of set of objects is only applicable to more than two elements
(systemic set) just as it is the plural meaning within the natural
language. Another observation which can be done is that in case of
the human IPS of external relations (the somatic nervous system), it
is possible that the emitter and the receiver of the information flux
to be the same (also the first person), in the process of thought
under a natural language. In this case, there is no need for the
conversion of the internal ISS into external ISS (vocal or visual),
the information flux being able to re-circulate inside IPS.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The abstract objects which are involved
in the abstract processes contained into the message can be singular
as well (that is at singular) or multiple (that is at plural), at the
first, second or third persons. The abstract objects included in the
message content may be either agent objects and/or driven objects (by
means of the abstract processes). Also, the abstract processes
contained into the message may belong to all the categories mentioned
in chapter 4 (singular, multiple, individual or collective) and they
aim to all the attribute types which may be part of the driven
abstract objects.</P>
