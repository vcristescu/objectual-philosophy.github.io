<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">9.3 External
language</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As we have mentioned in chapter 8,
<I>language</I> means a distribution of the semantic values on the
set of the syntactic values of some ISS. Depending on the internal or
external location of these ISS against RBS of an IPS, we are dealing
with internal and external ISS and accordingly, external and internal
languages. Such a language which has occurred in the human society
and which uses the ISS outside the human body is the natural
language.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Informationally speaking, the natural
language is an external <I>representation</I> form (against the RBS
of the human body) of a part from the information acquired and stored
in the brain, either by means of sound sequences (spoken language),
or by means of graphical symbols (written language). The information
which was already acquired through the <I>perception</I> system is
organized by the brain in a systemic manner, organization which
allows the optimum utilization of a finite resource: <I>the memory</I>.
This organization is based on the fact that each object from the real
world, perceived during our own existence is mentally related to
another object (obviously, to an abstract one), made-up from two
fundamental components: <I>the common information</I> with other
classes of objects and the <I>specific information</I> related to
that object. This abstract object (which represents a particular
object) with which we may operate when its <I>evocation </I>is
required (process which is equivalent with the memory reading in case
of AIPS), consists of a very large information amount (only the
visual attributes of a real object occupy tens or hundreds of MB,
without mentioning the other attributes such as the
olfactory/gustatory, tactile, kinesthetic, as well as the ones
achieved through artificial means or the processual attributes
associated to that particular object). Although this object may be
recalled every time we want to, an apparently insurmountable
difficulty seems to occur whenever we want to communicate this
information <U>to somebody else</U>.</P>
