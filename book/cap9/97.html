<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">9.7 Conclusions</H2>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The total amount of the
	qualitative and quantitative, semantic and syntactic information,
	associated to a material information support system (ISS) represents
	an <I>abstract object</I>.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The abstract objects are
	therefore, information existence forms, that is a notion with which
	only a special type of MS is able to operate - information
	processing system (IPS) - whose general model has been depicted in
	chapter 8.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A source MS of specific material
	fluxes which carries a finite number of the MS&rsquo;s properties,
	fluxes existent at the <I>present</I> moment of an IPS, and which
	are partly captured by it, represents a <I>real object</I> for that
	IPS.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The total amount of the real
	objects and processes at which these objects are subjected to at the
	same time, which have a simultaneous existence at the <I>present
	</I>moment of a certain IPS, makes-up the <I>individual direct
	reality</I> of that IPS.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there are more IPS which
	perceive simultaneously the same material objects and processes, the
	group of real objects and processes with a simultaneous existence
	for IPS set represents the <I>collective reality</I> of IPS set.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The total information amount about
	the real objects and processes which have a simultaneous existence
	within a temporal interval which includes the present moment,
	information stored into the internal or external memory of an IPS
	set, makes-up the <I>known reality</I> for that IPS set.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire information amount
	about the real objects and associated processes, which is assumed to
	exist simultaneously into the infinite space, makes-up the <I>absolute
	reality</I>. The absolute reality is a <I>virtual abstract object</I>
	(because it contains an infinite information amount), but which
	represents the basis of a dichotomous classification into other two
	abstract objects: <I>known reality and unknown reality</I> for a
	specific IPS set. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The information associated to an
	internal ISS of an IPS, as a result of the perception of a real
	object (ISS stored into IPS memory at the present moment),
	represents a <I>concrete</I> abstract object (synonym - <I>sensorial</I>),
	and that ISS is considered as the <I>internal representation</I> of
	the external object.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The information contained in a
	concrete abstract object consists of two components:</P>
</OL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The information which is <I>common</I>
	to other concrete abstract objects found into IPS memory;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The information which is specific
	to that particular abstract object, information which allows the
	object to be differentiated as compared to the rest of abstract
	objects from the memory.</P>
</UL>
<OL START=10>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The total information amount which
	is common to a set M of abstract objects represents the model of
	another abstract object - <I>class of abstract objects</I> M<I> </I>-
	object which does not represent any longer any external real object,
	being only a finite amount of semantic information associated to an
	internal ISS. The set M represents the <I>support</I> of that
	particular class. As a result of the association of a specific
	attribute to the class model, that abstract object becomes an
	<I>instance </I>(a particular object) of that class.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The information processing
	operation characterized by the extraction of the common component
	out of many information blocks is named<I> abstraction.</I> The
	first abstraction level, the unit fundamental level, is represented
	by the concrete abstract objects. These abstract objects represent
	(into IPS memory) a single real perceived object. The second
	abstraction level (notion) extracts the common component of a set of
	concrete abstract objects. The upper abstraction levels represent
	the common component of a set of notions.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As it was mentioned in chapter 8,
	a distribution of the semantic values on the set of syntactic values
	of an ISS class is named <I>language.</I> If that ISS class is
	external to an IPS, we are dealing with an <I>external language</I>.
	In case of this language, the semantic information which is
	associated to the syntactic values of the external ISS consists in
	huge amounts of semantic information associated by some internal ISS
	of a specific IPS, and which can be found inside its memory. The
	external ISS whose syntactic values represent outside IPS the
	information contained in its memory, are considered as <I>external
	representations</I> of the internal information.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In case of the natural human
	language, the external ISS are sequences of elementary sounds
	(phonemes) or graphical symbols (characters), sequences which are
	called words. The structural information of these ISS represents the
	<I>syntactic value</I> of the words, and the information from the
	IPS memory associated to these syntactic values represents the
	<I>semantic value</I> of those words. The external syntactic value
	(the word) which is associated within the natural language to a
	specific internal semantic value is the <I>name</I>.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there are external ISS fluxes
	between two or more IPS, and those IPS know the same language type,
	we may say that a communication process takes place. The information
	flux transmitted within the communication process through the
	natural language is made-up from three classes of abstract objects:
	<I>object_name</I> (the nouns and their substitutes, with all their
	flectional forms), <I>process_name </I>(the verbs with all their
	flectional forms) and the <I>determinants</I> (adjectives, numerals,
	articles, conjunctions, prepositions etc. also with their flectional
	forms). The total amount of the rules which regulates the flectional
	forms of the words depending on the associated semantic information
	makes-up the language syntax.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Due to the fact that the semantic
	information existent inside the memory of some communicating IPS is
	not the same, the communication process is able to effectively
	transmit only the common component of the information domains which
	exist into the communicator memory.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the abstract objects with a
	high level of abstraction is the <I>system</I>, notion which
	represents a complex (compound) abstract object with invariant
	interdependence relations of their properties, both between its
	elements and between each element and the internal reference of the
	complex object.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If every <I>material system</I> is
	a form of <I>matter</I> existence, with all these forms (material
	objects) having a similar generic model (the triad of fluxes model),
	we may assert that each <I>abstract system </I>is a form of the
	<I>information</I> existence. If the entire amount of MS and
	processes in which they are involved makes-up the <I>real world</I>,
	which is unique and independent from any IPS, the entire amount of
	abstract systems makes-up the <I>abstract world, </I>which is valid
	only for the IPS class, and which has sizes depending on their
	performance level. According to the criterion of the contained
	information amount, the abstract world is divided into the world of
	abstract <I>achievable </I>(realizable) objects (with associated
	finite information which can be included into an ISS with finite
	sizes) and the world of <I>virtual</I> abstract objects (with a
	related infinite information amount which requires an ISS with an
	infinite dimension).</P>
