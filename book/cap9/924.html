Abstraction level</H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As we
have mentioned in section 9.2.2, the representation of an external
object taken from the individual reality inside the memory of an IPS
is considered as an abstract concrete object, that is an object with
the first and the lowest abstraction level - the unit basic level.
This abstract object has always an external material correspondent,
source of the information carrier fluxes which were described in
chapter 8.</P>

9.2.4.1: When we discussed about ISS in chapter 8, we were saying
that any material system is a support for its <U>natural</U>
information (types of eferent fluxes, sizes, form etc.), information
which cannot be changed without altering the structure of that
particular MS. But when a MS must be the support of a certain
information, the structure of this system (its syntactic value) must
be easily and deterministically variable, depending on its containing
information. This is the difference between ISS as systems
specialized in the information storage and the information stored in
any external material object which is not specialized in such a
function. However, an object which is external to an IPS, either it
is an external ISS or a certain MS, is considered for that IPS as a
real object which is associated to an abstract concrete object.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

9.2.4.2: As we have mentioned above, the notion is an abstract object
which does not represent a real external object any longer, otherwise
speaking, it is an object which may be realizable at the abstract
level, but which cannot be realizable at the material level; it is
nothing but a finite information amount associated to an internal ISS
of an IPS. For becoming a material realizable object, the notion must
be associated to the specific attributes in order to become an
abstract concrete object - the only type of abstract object
materially realizable - provided that its attributes to comply with
the material achievement conditions which are far more restrictive
than the abstract achievement conditions.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

9.2.4.3: The extraction function of the common component from a set
of abstract objects is a function which according to the objectual
philosophy is considered to be implemented in all NIPS, because this
function is based even on the organization method of the processes
guided by the DNA molecule. If a new organism undergoes a synthesis
process, this process always starts with the common components (stem
cells) and it continues with the differential components (cell
differentiating processes). In case of the abstraction, we are
dealing with a reverse process, from differential (abstract concrete
objects) towards common (the notion). In this stage of presentation,
it is the moment to observe with a certain amount of surprise that
the abstraction processes, as they have been defined in this paper,
can also occur at other bio-systems which own a somatic nervous
system (which have sensory organs used for external fluxes). The
mammals, for instance, have perception systems which are very similar
with the human&rsquo;s perception systems, which makes obvious that
the first abstraction level (inherently attached to any sense organ)
is present in this case, but it is very likely that a second level to
be also found - that is the class model (notion). The fact that the
people, unlike the rest of the animals, have associated a name to a
notion within the natural language (as we are about to see later on),
it does not mean that abstraction processes cannot occur at the other
animals as well.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

generates a notion whose support set is entirely made-up from
