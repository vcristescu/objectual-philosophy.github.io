Concatenated specific elementary processes</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">We have seen that a
SEP (represented by a vector) is an even process, of defined
variation of a state attribute, between two values - the initial and
final state. If the final state of a process SEP<SUB>1</SUB> (<I>S</I><SUB><I>02</I></SUB>
in fig.4.5.1) becomes an initial state for other SEP<SUB>2</SUB>
process, we might say that the two processes are <I>concatenated </I>(or
linked, in case of the temporal support processes<I>, successive</I>
SEP). This abstract process of concatenation may go on as long as
possible, specific and individual processes of any kind could be
represented in this way, so in the same manner as any type of
distribution, no matter how complex it is, can be decomposed into
even elementary distributions.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The figure 4.5.1 shows two such
concatenated SEP, namely SEP<SUB>1</SUB> and SEP<SUB>2</SUB> which
according to the relations 4.4.5 and 4.4.7 have a common component
<B>C</B><SUB>12</SUB> = C(SEP<SUB>1</SUB>, SEP<SUB>2</SUB>) and the
specific component (of SEP<SUB>2</SUB> against SEP<SUB>1</SUB>) <B>D</B><SUB>12</SUB>
= D(<B>C</B><SUB>12</SUB>, SEP<SUB>2</SUB>) determined against the
same reference direction of the <U>previous SEP</U>. The common
component has the same direction with the reference direction and the
specific component has the orthogonal direction oriented on the
reference direction.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We may notice that two successive SEP
shall have the same direction if there is no specific component

4.5.1: Introduction of the common and specific component concepts of
two concurrent SEP and of their definition relations, provides new
means for defining hard or incorrectly defined notions. One of these
notions is for instance, the straight line definition. According to
the elementary mathematics textbooks, the frequent definition of this
abstract object is the following one: &ldquo;The straight line is the
shortest way between two points&rdquo;. This definition mode
enunciates an optimal property of the straight line (as a result of a
selection between all the possible pathways between the two points)
but not also the generation process of this kind of object. The
utilization of the common and differential component notions of two
SEP, which is also applicable for the concatenated processes, allows
a processual definition of the straight line: &ldquo;A series of
concatenated first rank SEP, at which the specific component of two
adjacent SEP is invariantly null is represented by a straight line&rdquo;.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cause for the occurrence of the
differential components into a set of concatenated SEP shall be
revealed in the following chapters or annexes. For the time being, we
notice that the absence of such a component leads to an even process
with the same direction, represented by a straight line according to
the visual-graphical syntax, as we have aforementioned. This fact
explains the graphical representation under the form of straight
lines (axes) of the continuous set of values belonging to an
one-dimensional attribute (this is obvious because since there is a
single dimension, the differential component of the direction between
two successive variations cannot exist), but this fact is also the
basic explanation of the motion along a rectilinear trajectory of the
material systems which are not subjected to the action of some forces
with a normal component on its trajectory, that is a special
situation - the absence of the action exerted by any force -
corresponding to the motion of an isolated MS with an initial
velocity.</P>
