<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">4.6 Specific
elementary processes with spatial support</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">At the beginning of
this chapter we have mentioned that the processes are a class of
special distributions which are characterized by the variation of an
attribute, as a distributed amount. The type of the support attribute
is another criterion for the processes classification. From this
point of view, the processes which have the temporal attribute as
their support are considered to be models for the real processes, and
the ones with other support type (spatial, frequential etc.) are
models for some of the abstract processes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.2in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
4.6.1: The assertion that the temporal support processes are models
for the real processes must be accepted with tolerance by the reader,
because it contains only a half-truth. The real processes, in which
the material systems are involved may be actually, as we are about to
see in the following chapters, spatio-temporal or frequency-temporal
distributions. Otherwise speaking, the real situation is much more
complex but in the scope of this chapter, a short simplified
expression is allowed.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As we shall see in
the chapter 9 which is focused on the abstract objects (objects with
whom the IPS class can operate), there is also a class of processes
in which the variations of the properties of some <I>information
support systems </I>(ISS) are involved - these are the abstract
processes. This kind of process occurs within ISS medium (which shall
be minutely approached in chapter 8), either inside of an IPS or on
the external ISS. In the purpose of this paragraph, we must mention
that specific elementary processes also exist for the abstract
processes and these are similar with the above-mentioned ones, being
representable by means of vectors, but they can have both temporal,
spatial or frequencial intervals as support ranges.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">An example of such
an abstract SEP is the one in which the attribute variation has a
spatial support, when SEP represents the even state variation of an
attribute between two points of different and invariant spatial
location. This spatial distribution of the variation of an attribute
is also representable by means of SEP (namely, by means of vectors),
but those particular vectors are variations between two <U>simultaneous</U>
states, but located in two different spatial positions. The density
of this type of SEP with spatial support in case of a scalar primary
distribution is known as the <I>directional derivative</I> of that
distribution, according to the theory of vectorial fields, and the
direction on which this derivative has maximum values represents the
<I>gradient</I> direction of that distribution (see annex X.8). The
gradient is a local <I>S</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB> state of a scalar
distribution with spatial support.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
4.6.2: If the reader shall analyze the classic relation which defines
the gradient from annex X.8 by comparing it with the definition
relation of the first rank density of a multiple support
distribution, he might find out the resemblance between the two
abstract objects. In this way, it may be noticed that the gradient of
a scalar spatial 3D distribution is a vector (namely a SEP) which
represents the total variation of the attribute assigned between two
points, that is the amount of the specific variations according to
the three support coordinates. Obviously, the distance between the
two points is selected so that the density of the specific
distributions to be considered as even.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Within the same
category of SEP distributions with spatial support, but with a much
more complex definition, the <I>curl</I> and <I>divergence</I> of a
vector field are also included. We shall not minutely review these
kind of processes because they are depicted in the textbooks on the
vector fields theory, the sole intention of this section is to
include some of these abstract objects into their appropriate
classes, according to the classification system of the objectual
philosophy, and to point out once again the fact that <U>any SEP may
be represented by means of a vector</U>.</P>
