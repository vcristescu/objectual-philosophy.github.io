<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">4.8 Motion
processes</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">A basic class of
processes, especially for the material objects is represented by
those specific processes in which the variable attribute is the
<I>spatial position</I> of an object (in case of an individual
process) or of a set of objects (subject which shall be minutely
analyzed in the next chapter focused on fluxes), which are called
<I>motion</I> processes. We have seen in the previous chapter that
the position of an object is in fact the position of the object&rsquo;s
inner reference against an external reference. The object&rsquo;s
motion is therefore a variation of the position of this internal
reference against the external reference. This motion may be
decomposed into motions of the internal reference system&rsquo;s (RS)
components against the same components of an external RS. The spatial
RS which were briefly mentioned in the previous chapters are the <I>T</I>
reference (common component of the reference axes), and <I>R</I>
reference (the specific directions of the three axis <I><B>X, Y, Z</B></I>).
The spatial position of the <I>T</I> inner reference of the object is
given by the position vector 
<IMG SRC="48_html_57d051f5.gif" NAME="Object164" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=21>which
unites the two references - external <I>T</I> reference (application
point which is invariant by definition), and the internal <I>T</I>
reference of the object. Since the position vector has an invariant
application point, it belongs to the class of bound vectors, its
other attributes besides the application point being the size
(module, magnitude) and the direction (defined in relation to the
external R reference).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The overall
(global) motion of an object shall be made-up, according to the
above-mentioned issues, from the variations of the two elements which
define the object&rsquo;s spatial position, the two components
belonging to the spatial RS: <I>T</I> and <I>R</I> references.
Because we are dealing with two qualitatively different attributes,
we shall have two types of specific processes.</P>

4.8.1: The reader is invited to observe the approaching differences
on the objects motion, between the objectual philosophy and the
classic approaches. The objectual-processual approach specific to
this paper takes strictly into consideration the variable attribute,
because a single qualitative attribute must be variable in case of a
specific process. According to this approach, the motion of an object
means the motion of its inner reference system against an outer
reference. <I>T</I> reference belongs to the inner RS and it can be
considered as a null rotation point, therefore, it is able to
generate only translation motions, and <I>R</I> reference is made-up
only from directions, and as a result of this fact, it is able to
operate only rotation motions. Thus, it becomes very clear that the
rotation motions can be attributed only to the vectors (either the
position ones or the ones which make-up <I>R</I> reference). The
rotation of an object means also the rotation of its inner R
reference (against the outer R reference), that is a rotation which
generates however a lot of revolution motions of all the inner
elements of the objects which have non-null inner position vectors.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Depending on the
above-mentioned definitions and on the variable attribute, we could
point out few specific motion processes, which shall be presented
only because that the reader to understand the objectual-processual

	both as a module and as a direction, but the angular position of the
	inner R reference is time variable; in this case, we are dealing
	with a <I>rotation </I>of the object, decomposable along its three
	possible simultaneous rotation axes and determined against the outer
	R reference. As we have also mentioned in the comment 4.8.1, it is
	worth noticing that a rotation of a compound object is decomposable
	in the same number of inner revolution motions of the object&rsquo;s
	elements.</P>

4.8.2: If there is an invariant relation between the direction of the
position vector and the inner R reference of the object which
operates the revolution motion, then a rotation motion of the
position vector determines also a self-rotation of the object (around
an axis which is parallel with the rotation axis of the position
vector). This is the case of S-type media (which shall be defined in
the following chapters, but which are momentarily assimilated with
the solids), in which there are invariant relations both between T
references and between R references of the constitutive objects (the
free translation and the free rotation of the elements are
forbidden). In this case, a rotation motion of the S-type compound
object determines, besides the revolutions of the inner elements,
also a simultaneous rotation of each constitutive element (a curl
vector field with an even distribution is generated).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	(obviously, an external one) being produced in this case. As also
	regards the pure translation (except the case when its direction

4.8.3: It is well-known that in order to maintain an electro-magnetic
communication with a space probe, directional (paraboloidal) aerials
are attached both on the probe and on the ground station, whose axes
must be kept as collinear as possible (an invariant relation must
exist between their directions). The space probe is a S-type object
with an inner RS against which the aerial has a steady direction. The
probe trajectory is usually a closed curve, its position vector
(against the terrestrial RS) has a variable direction, therefore,
either the ground control centre, or a control system within the
probe must permanently initiate the forced rotation of the probe in
order to align the axes of the two aerials, simultaneously with the
rotation of the axis of the aerial located on the ground. In this
case, the direction of the ground aerial axis corresponds with the
direction of the position vector of the probe against the terrestrial
RS, direction against which the control system of the probe&rsquo;s
rotating position must maintain an invariant relation. It is clear
that the probe&rsquo;s rotation depends only on the direction of the
position vector (regardless of the distance towards the probe), and
the intensity of electro-magnetic flux received from the probe (which
depends only on the distance, in case of the alignment of the aerials
axes) is independent from its direction. This example implies an
artificial invariant relation between RS of two objects (that is a
informational relation maintained by some automatic control systems),
but there are also numerous situations in which this relation is
natural. That is the above-depicted case of S objects, but also of
the natural satellites with isochronous orbital and axial movements
(such as the Moon, the great Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites, etc.). As
also regards these satellites, there is an invariant relation between
the inner R reference of the satellite and the direction of its
position vector against the central planet.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">At
the </FONT>paragraph 4.5, we have seen that a certain specific and
individual process may be decomposed into concatenated SEP, and these
SEP are uniform variations with the invariant direction (vectors).
According to the above-mentioned motion types, we may notice that the
translation process belongs to this SEP class. Therefore, any type of
translation motion is decomposable in series of elementary
translations. We might also add that a pure translation with a
constant velocity is a <I>P</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB>-type of<SUB>
</SUB>process, while its temporal density (uniform velocity) and its
direction, a <I>S</I><SUB><I>1</I></SUB>-type of state.</P>
