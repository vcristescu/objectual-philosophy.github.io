<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">There is a special
symbolistic used for SEP (regardless their rank), because this type
of process is the basis (element) of all the other processes,
otherwise speaking, any process, no matter how complex it is, may be
decomposed into this kind of elementary processes. According to the
visual syntax, both literal but mostly graphical, this kind of symbol
used for SEP&rsquo;s graphical representation is the <I>vector.</I></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">This symbol is a
graphical substitute for an even attribute variation, that is a
variation between two states: initial and final (corresponding with
the two boundaries of the support interval). The two states are
represented by two points whose positions are the attributes of the
two state objects, and between them, there is a right-oriented
segment which denotes the state&rsquo;s even variation. Oriented
segment means that a certain direction was imposed (symbolized by the
arrow direction), direction which shows a positive variation between
the initial and final state. The size (length) of the right-oriented
segment is proportional to the amount of variation between the two
states (variation&rsquo;s amplitude)<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>1</SUP></A>6.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Depending on the
information contained in the <I>vector</I> object, we shall have many
types of such objects, whose denominations are already known in the
scientific literature, but their approach method is a little bit
different as compared to the method used in the present paper:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Free vectors</I>, for which

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Most of the vectors
used in the vectorial calculus and in the vector fields theory from
mathematics are free vectors. Subject matters such as Materials
Strength or Hydrostatics operate with vector distributions with bound
vectors, but there is also another important class of such vectors in
mathematics and physics - the position vectors (bound by the origin
of RS). The carrier vectors shall be the class of vectors used in the
present paper as mathematic model for fluxes.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">One may observe
that when defining the vector-type objects, as well as of the
substituted SEP, a new attribute occurs - that is the <I>direction</I>.
This attribute is very important for SEP representation, therefore,
it shall be minutely analyzed later on in this paper.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The figures 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 shows a
representation in the visual-graphical syntax of SEP (vectors) in two
special cases:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the variable attribute has a
	single qualitative component, in our case, it is <I>X</I> from the
	figure 4.4.1, attribute which is also called as <I>one-dimensional.</I>
	The values domain (domain of the existential attribute) of this
	qualitative attribute is a segment from the set (virtual or
	realizable, see annex X.3) of the real numbers {R}. An even
	variation of the value of this attribute means an even, successive
	covering of all the values from its values domain, running from an
	initial to a final value. The restriction that all these covered
	values to be included in a one-dimensional domain makes that this
	kind of running-through to have only two distinct attributes:
	<I>positive sense</I> (considered as the increasing one, which means
	that the value of the final state to be higher than the one of the
	initial state) and the <I>negative sense</I> (reverse situation).
	This attribute - that is the sense - characteristic for the specific
	processes with an one-dimensional attribute (1D), can have therefore
	only two values (+ or -). We may notice that the sense of a
	variation, represented by its <U>sign</U> can be independent from
	the actual values of the two states (initial and final), but it is
	important only that the difference between them to have the required
	sign. This case is typical for the free vectors, as in the example
	from the figure 4.4.1<I><B> r</B></I><SUB><I>X1</I></SUB>. The
	situation is different if the initial state is settled, in this
	case, the value <I>x</I><SUB><I>R</I></SUB>. In such a situation, we
	are dealing with a new abstract object, that is the <I>direction,
	</I>for the one-dimensional case with only two possible values,
	corresponding to the two possible senses of the variation against
	the reference <I>x</I><SUB><I>R</I></SUB> (vectors <I>-</I><I><B>r</B></I><SUB><I>X2</I></SUB>
	and <I>+</I><I><B>r</B></I><SUB><I>X2</I></SUB><SUB> </SUB>displayed
	in the figure 4.4.1). We shall see next that there is a way of
	defining the direction in a much more accurate manner in case of the
	multidimensional vectors.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the variable attribute has
	two qualitative <I>independent</I> components (see definition
	2.1.2), in this case, <I>X</I> and <I>Y</I> from the figure 4.4.2,
	attribute which is also called as <I>two-dimensional</I>. In this
	case, it may be noticed that a certain SEP of the attribute<I><B>
	r</B></I><I>(X,Y)</I> is composed from two independent SEP
	(simultaneous and one-dimensional) <I><B>r</B></I><SUB><I>X</I></SUB>
	and <I><B>r</B></I><SUB><I>Y</I></SUB>. These components are
	determined against a common reference (origin of axes O), each of
	them having the direction of the axis in which they are included (as
	we have seen in case 1) which is settled in relation to this
	reference. We may also assert that a variation <I>r</I> (an absolute
	one in case given in the figure 4.4.2) of a compound two-dimensional
	object is the result of the two independent variations (also
	absolute) and each of them contribute in a certain extent to the
	total variation. The two components from the figure 4.4.2 display
	even these contributions (also known as projections).</P>

4.4.1: The components of the numerical direction defined in relations
4.4.1, as a ratio between two linear variations (two P<SUB>1</SUB>-type
processes) are clearly dimensionless (that is why they were called
numerical). The angular direction are defined in mathematics field as
the ratio between the length of a circular arc (<IMG SRC="44_html_m4a7ad2aa.gif" NAME="Object150" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=24>from
the figure 4.4.2) and its radius, fact which made the mathematicians
to assert that the angle is dimensionless (that is also a number).
However, the process analysis of the two involved abstract processes
- circular arc and the radius of that circle - tells us something
else. The circle radius is a right segment, therefore, a P<SUB>1</SUB>
process, as we have seen so far, but the circular arc is a P<SUB>2</SUB>
process. The reader is invited to decide by himself if the ratio
between two processes of different ranks is dimensionless or not.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

direction). A relevant property of the common and specific components
of a vector against the concurrent reference vector is that all these
vectors are <I>coplanar.</I> The discussion on a two-dimensional SEP
may be extended in the same way to the three-dimensional vectors, by
adding obviously the component after the axis <B>Z, </B>but the issue
is more complex and it is not the subject of this section, because
its scope is to enlighten the reader on the correspondence between a
vector and a SEP.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We cannot end this short description of
the vector representation for SEP without making a specification. All
SEP may be represented by means of vectors, but not all the vectors
represent SEP, more exactly, there are vectors which represent <U>only
reference directions</U>, without representing state variations as
well. Such a category of vectors are the versors of the axes which
were briefly above-mentioned, but also the ones which make-up the
local <I>R</I> references of a curve or of a spatial surface, which
are the <I>tangent, normal </I>and<I> binormal.</I> These vectors do
not represent SEP but only reference directions which are valid in
their application point.</P>

	It is worth keeping in mind that in case of a realizable SEP, there
	is no restriction imposed regarding their amount (magnitude), the
	only condition to fulfill is the <U>evenness</U> of their density
	along the support interval, and that is because an even distribution
	is an elementary distribution.</P>

	Attention! In this paper, the projections of a vector are vectors
	too, because the components of a vector are also vectors. This
	specification is made because the relation 4.4.5 may be mistaken
	with the dot product between vector <B>r</B> and axis <B>X; </B>the
	projection module is indeed equal to the dot product, but the vector
	is oriented on the axis direction.</P>
