<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Taking into
consideration the aforementioned issues, a contradiction seems to
occur (we might call it dichotomous contradiction) between the
imperative <U>invariance</U> necessity required by the <U>object</U>
model, and other <U>variation</U> imperative need required by the
<U>process</U> model. Every time a contradiction appears, a
negotiation takes place (#), which shall eventually lead to a
compromise (an equilibrium) between two contradictory demands. In
chapter 8, we shall see that the biotic systems have settled this
dispute favorable to the objects, the processes being represented as
systems of objects. The cause of this &ldquo;choice&rdquo; shall be
also found out in the same chapter when the general IPS will be
analyzed.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Now, let us return
to the objects and processes. As we have also pointed out in par.3.1,
in the comment to the axiom 1, in order to exist an object, it must
be created during a special type of process - that is the <I>generation
process</I>.</P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Obviously, the
attribute variation during a generating process is also determined
against a reference, but this time, it is an absolute reference. Any
of the attributes of an object must be considered as a result of a
generating process specific to that attribute. These processes may be
either simultaneous (multiple) or successive (spaced out in time as
external composition processes), real or abstract. The scope of this
paragraph is not focused on the deep analysis of the generating
processes, but only on their categorization as basic processes,
without whom the objects and all which derives from objects would not
be able to exist. At the completion of the generating process, the
invariant values of all the attributes of object <I>Ob</I> taken from
<U>one</U> temporal DP with an inner reference <I>t</I> (which is
equivalent in the common language with a singular normal value of
time, that is <I>t </I>moment) representing the <I>state </I>of
object <I>Ob</I> at that moment, according to definition 4.2.1 (if a
subsequent special specification would not be made, we are dealing

4.3.1: The above-mentioned specification regarding the duration of
the sampling time is relevant in general circumstances, when the
attributes of the considered object are variable (there are non-null
processes); in this case, as we have previously mentioned, on the
duration of a temporal DP any process has an insignificant (by
definition) variation (it may be considered as null). If these
processes are missing, the state of the analyzed object is preserved
as long as the processes are null.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

4.3.3: It is very important for the reader to understand that we
might also talk about an <I>object </I>(obviously, an abstract one)
in case of a <I>process</I>, although (as we have mentioned above),
the two concepts seem to be contradictory. Indeed, we are facing with
a contradiction when we are dealing with <U>one and the same
attribute</U>. In the same temporal support interval, the same
attribute - let us say the spatial position - cannot be invariant and
variable at the same time. But if the attribute is variable and its
variation rate (velocity) is constant within the process&rsquo;
support interval, this rate is an invariant attribute, assigned on
that support, namely, an abstract object. In the general case,
although process means a distribution of some attribute variations,
all the invariant attributes of the process existing in a certain
support interval (such as the variation rate, direction, frequency in
case of the periodic processes, etc.) shall make-up a S<SUB>n</SUB>
-type abstract object of that particular process.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
