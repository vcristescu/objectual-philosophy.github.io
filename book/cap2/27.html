<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">2.7 Conclusions</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The meaning of the <I>distribution
</I>concept used across this paper is not much more different as
compared to the dictionary meaning, namely: allotment, division of a
property (attribute) to some elements belonging to a set of objects
which may own that property (see also the annexes X.2 and X.3).
Taking into account the above-mentioned issues, there are few <SPAN STYLE="background: #ff00ff">
</SPAN>conclusions  to retain:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A <I>distribution</I> is an
	abstract object made-up from a set of assignment relations of a
	property, on the objects of a support set. There is a strict,
	univocal correspondence between the two sets, each support object
	(which corresponds to an AAV in case of virtual distributions) must
	be related to an assignment relation and a value of the distributed
	attribute (even if this latter value is null).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the assignment relation has the
	same form (invariant structure) for the entire support domain, that
	particular relation is the classic <I>continuous function</I> from
	mathematics field.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distribution inside a
	<I>distribution element</I> of an allotted property is an elementary
	distribution (either it is even in case of the realizable primary
	distributions, or linear, in case of realizable derived
	distributions). For such an element, a distribution <I>density</I>
	is defined as a ratio between the variation of the distributed
	attribute which comes from the assignment relation and the variation
	(amount) of the support (we shall see in the next chapter that the
	values implied in the primary distribution element are also
	variations, but variations against an absolute reference). 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any type of uneven distribution is
	decomposable in elementary distributions, evenly or evenly variable.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The virtual distributions (from
	mathematics) are the asymptotic models (virtual objects toward which
	the realizable objects tend to) of the realizable distributions.
	Only for this type of distributions, the infinite, continuous
	support domains or AAV singular support values are allowed.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
2.7.1:<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> </FONT>The fact that the
distributions have a higher generality level, as compared to the
classic mathematical functions, this also provides a higher
generality degree to the theoretical papers which are dealing with
distributions. According to the current physics and chemistry (based
almost entirely on functions), the properties of the studied objects
are divided in two categories: <I>extensive </I>and <I>intensive</I>
properties. The value of the extensive properties depends on the size
of the object which owns the property, and the intensive ones are
independent from these sizes. For example, the volume of a body, the
number of elements (atoms or molecules) of the body, its total mass
and energy are extensive properties, while the mass density,
temperature, pressure, are intensive properties. By using the
distributions, we may observe that the <I>extensive</I> properties
are <U>distributions</U> or <U>stocks</U> of some distributions,
while the intensive properties are <U>inner references</U> or
<U>densities</U> of some distributions. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
