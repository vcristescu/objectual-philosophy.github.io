<H1 STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ch.2 DISTRIBUTIONS</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="_2.1_Introducere"></A>2.1 Overview</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reader is warned right from the
start that the way how the distributions are approached in the
present paper is different as compared to the style used in the works
regarding the distributions theory, drawn-up by mathematicians<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>3</SUP></A>.
This different approach was not chosen only for simply making all
different, but due to other reasons:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first from these reasons is
	the existence of a contradiction in the classic approach of the
	distributions, that is the rigor used within the differential and
	integral calculus for defining the notions such as <I>derivative,
	differential, primitive, integral</I> etc. which are valid only by
	mentioning the expression &ldquo;<U>for continuous functions only</U>&rdquo;
	along the continuous interval of their arguments, and the easy
	application of these notions also in case of the distributions with
	a clearly discontinuous character. Moreover, sometimes it is talking
	about a differentiation &ldquo;in a classic, algebraic manner&rdquo;
	and a differentiation &ldquo;under the meaning of distributions&rdquo;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym" SDFIXED><SUP>4</SUP></A></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another reason for the different
	approach of the distributions in the present paper comes from the
	specific organization of the information structure established by
	the objectual philosophy. According to this organization, the
	semantic information which is found in a message is mainly made-up
	from <I>objects</I> and <I>processes</I> (at which the objects are
	subjected to), the distributions being basic elements for defining
	these notions, as we are about to notice in the following chapters.
	Due to this reason, the definition of distributions had to be in
	compliance with this organization method.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another reason which has
	determined the definition of distributions according to the selected
	mode is related to the purpose of their utilization. As I have
	already mentioned above, the distributions are in this paper a
	mathematical model used for representation of the objects (including
	the material ones), as entities which have a lot of properties (such
	as the shape, color, mass density, hardness, etc.), who are
	distributed on the object&rsquo;s surface or in the volume of the
	object. These elements of the concrete distributions are the values
	of those attributes in a certain point (a certain space location)
	which belongs to the object; in other words, the value of the
	attribute depends through a certain relation, on the location,
	actual position of that point. We shall see next, if these
	dependence relations would be able to be independent from the actual
	location of the point, and, at least for certain zones of the
	object, we might use (only for those zones) the classic functions
	from the mathematical analysis. Unfortunately, for most of the real
	objects, the above mentioned dependence relations are not invariant,
	they can be even random, therefore, other mathematical instruments
	must be used for expressing these dependence relations, such as the
	distributions, which are more general than the functions.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The approach according to the objectual
philosophy model of the distributions, clearly settles the conditions
when the old differential and integral calculus can be used, and the
conditions required for using <I>the calculus with finite
differences, </I>which is<I> </I>more difficult and less elegant, but
universally applicable. In the latter case, the notion of <I>local
derivative </I>(such as it is defined within the differential
calculus, as a derivative in a point), does not make sense anymore;
it is replaced by a more general term which is called <I>density, </I>and
the derived functions (any rank) are replaced by the derived
distributions (any rank, too).</P>
