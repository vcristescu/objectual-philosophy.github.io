<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The notion of<I>
distribution </I>from mathematics has been introduced as a
generalization of the <I>function </I>concept, in order to also allow
oprerations with the dependence between different variables, which
could not be considered as functions, strictly algebraically speaking
(for example, the discontinuous dependences). Few examples of this
kind of discontinuous distributions, with a wide application field
can be mentioned and these are: Dirac distribution

(also known as the <I>step function</I>), etc.</P>

understanding of the distributions, it must be first understood the
notion of <I>dependence </I>between the values of two <I>amounts.</I></P>

2.2.1: The meaning of the very general term of <I>amount</I>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">(magnitude, size) </SPAN>used in the mathematics
field could be better understood by the reader after reading the
entire paper, especially chapter 9. The only explanation which is
made in advance is that an attribute (that is a property of a real or
abstract object) has two components, according to the objectual
philosophy: the <I>qualitative </I>component, represented by  the
name or the symbol of that property (property&rsquo;s semantic value)
and the <I>quantitative</I> component, which is also called
<I>existential attribute</I> in the present paper, a number (scalar)
which shows the measure (size, amount, degree) of existence of that
property. As we are about to see next, the two components are
conjunctively associated within the relationships in this paper,
which means that, in case of a certain object, they can exist only
together (a null value for the existential attribute implies the
non-existence of an associated qualitative property). In mathematics,
for providing the language universality, the associated qualitative
attribute is most of the times let aside, operating in most of the
cases only with existential attributes (numerical values), or with
literal or graphic symbols for displaying them. Because it cannot be
omitted the fact that the numerical values are however the attributes
of some properties, in case of real objects, this aspect shall be
mentioned anywhere necessary. Basically, this is not a mathematic
paper, but the mathematic is used as an universal language for
expressing the relations between various amounts.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Let us assume that there is a
qualitative attribute <I>X,</I> which belongs to a certain object
which is related to a quantitative attribute <I>x</I> at a certain
moment, whose possible numerical values make-up an ordered set <I>{x}</I>.
In mathematics, the quantitative value <I>x</I> which may belong to a
property <I>X</I> is called <I>amount x</I>, and because it can take
any value from <I>{x}</I>, it is also known as the <I>variable x</I>.
By assuming also that there is another qualitative property <I>Y</I>,
with the existential attribute <I>y</I>, whose values belong to set
<I>{y}</I>, another amount <I>y </I>(or variable) is therefore
made-up. If the value <I>y</I> is modified as a result of changing
the value <I>x</I> and it remains invariant if <I>x</I> is invariant
too, we may say that there is a <I>dependence relation</I> between
the two amounts. This relation may be univocal (in a single sense) or
biunivocal (interdependence). For the time being, we are only
interested in the univocal dependence relation, the univocal
character being presumed when we are talking about dependence. The
sets of numerical values <I>{x}</I> and <I>{y}</I> which were
above-mentioned, have <I>the singular numerical values, </I>as basic
(non-decomposable) elements.</P>

2.2.2: The association of &ldquo;invariant&rdquo; property to a
variable seems to be quite bizarre in the first place, that is why an
explanation is needed. At a certain moment, when concrete numerical
values are given to a variable, both the independent and the
dependent variable have only a single value. It is true that the two
variables can take any kind of single value from their values domain,
but by means of <U>repeated</U>, <U>successive</U> assignments for
each value. The variables values remain invariant between two
assignments. The reader will better understand this aspect after
reading the entire chapter, because the fact that a quantitative
attribute (numerical value of a variable) cannot have more than one
value at a certain moment, this will be considered as a consequence
of the specific approach of the objectual philosophy regarding the
distribution&rsquo;s definition.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

Even if it is not necessary, we shall make once again the following

<U>the same number of elements</U> (they are equipotent sets).</P>

the total amount of attribute y, distributed along the support domain
represents the <B>stock </B>of the primary distribution. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">In case of the
virtual distributions with continuous support, this support is
usually represented by an interval from the set of the real numbers
{R}, and this set, as we have previously mentioned, contains an
infinite number of singular values in any interval, also resulting
that the number of the relations from a distribution on this kind of
range should also be infinite. The question is simplified if the
relation <I>f</I> is <U>invariant</U><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym" SDFIXED><SUP>7</SUP></A>
along the support domain or along its subdomains (independent from
the concrete, numerical values which are assigned to <I>x</I>). In
this case, that particular relation is the classic <I>continuous
function</I> stipulated in the mathematic analysis (where the term
&ldquo;continuous&rdquo; means both the support continuity, but
mostly the maintenance of the same dependence relations on the
support range), which may be applied in the domain where this
invariance is maintained. The continuous functions are therefore
particular cases of distributions.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The main advantage
of the continuous functions is that they replace an infinity of
individual relations (for each numerical support value) with a single
one, which is valid on its support domain (continuity domain). Most
of the virtual distributions (mathematic) consist of several
invariant relations of this kind (functions), which are defined on
continuous subranges of the support domain, the gathering of this
subranges making-up the overall distribution support.</P>

tangent of the angle between the primary linear distribution and the

making some observations concerning the differences between the
mathematical models introduced, and the objects from the classic
mathematics (differences which also exist in other mathematical
fields and which are minutely approached in annex X.3). First of all,
it is revealed the preoccupation of the objectual philosophy for the
clear structure of each used object (abstract), moreover for the
non-decomposable elements of this structure, which are the basic
elements. Once with the definition of these elements and of the
relations between them, a coherent structure of the whole mechanism
is revealed (the object made-up from these elements), even if this
object look (and it is otherwise denominated) in the official
mathematics.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> If there are not too many differences
between the primary distributions and the mathematic distributions
(besides the unusual concept on the density of an element or of a
function), the situation is not the same in case of the derived
distributions where there are major differences. The definition mode
of the derived distributions (and implicitly of the derived
functions) is much more different from the one used within the
differential calculus. An object similar with the classic <I>n</I>-ranked
local derivative of a function <I>f</I> is, according to the
objectual philosophy, <I>the density </I>of a <I>n</I>-ranked derived
