<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Besides the
differences pointed out in the previous sections, the distributed
systems also have common features, the most important deriving from
the fact that the interaction between the elements occurs along a
short distance. Due to this reason, the variation of the interaction
intensity at the system&rsquo;s borderline shall not be instantly
conveyed to all the elements, but rather gradually, to one by one.</P>

6.5.1: Axiom II seems to be more like a logical conclusion after all
the aspects which were depicted about the distributed material
systems. However, the current science asserts that there can be
propagation processes through vacuum, namely, in the absence of a
support medium for this kind of process (see also section 1.5).
Consequently, the above-mentioned statement has been promoted as an
axiom for emphasizing once again that the assumption on the ether
non-existence is a fallacy. One thing is to assign the negative
result of the Michelson-Morley test to the ignorance regarding the
properties of this medium, or of a model which is insufficiently
elaborated for the propagation process, and other thing is the
assertion that there are propagation processes of some real amounts
into&hellip;nothing.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The propagation
velocity of a wave depends on the parameters of that medium and it is
not the topic of the present paper. It is only relevant that this
velocity increases in proportion to the duration and the intensity of
the interaction deployed between the system&rsquo;s elements<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>2</SUP></A>7,
which is higher in case of the media having a permanent duration of
this interaction. It is also worth noticing that the propagation does
not involve the displacement of the medium&rsquo;s elements once with
the wave front, with the propagation velocity, but only low
<I>modulations </I>of their relative positions against the
equilibrium position, or of the other medium&rsquo;s statistical
parameters.</P>

6.5.2: <I>The modulation </I>is a reversible modification (variation)
process of an amount against a value which is considered (at least
temporarily) as a reference value. Depending on the parameter which
is modified, the amplitude, frequency, phase modulations are known
facts. If the modulated parameter is the system&rsquo;s position
vector, a spatial modulation of the intensity of the field generated
by the system might occur. It is self-understood that any modulation
has also a time distribution, therefore, the modulation of a medium
attribute is a process with a spatial-temporal distribution.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Another very
significant feature of the propagation process is that <U>the
object</U><U><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym" SDFIXED><SUP>2</SUP></A>8</U><U>
which is conveyed</U> (which was above-referred to as wave front) <U>is
not made-up from the same elements of the propagation medium</U>,
since its constitutive parts are always different, but the energy
contained inside it (we call it the distributed attribute stockpile)
is always the same - the one contained in the initial front coming
from the source<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym" SDFIXED><SUP>2</SUP></A>9.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">There are different
wave types which are propagated inside a DS, depending on the local
state attribute which fluctuates or depending on the motion type
which the element might have within the distributed system. Thus, in
case of S media, for the three possible (but not free) translation
directions, the compression waves (or longitudinal) are associated,
and as for the rotation motions, the transversal (or shearing) waves
are associated. In case of L media, there could be only the
compression waves, and only in a less extent, the transversal
(viscosity) waves. As regards G media, it is obvious that there can
be only the pressure waves by means of the modulation of the free
pathway (resulting a modulation of the interactions frequency).<BR>

	We are referring to the media composed from the same type of
	elements, but which are within different phases (S, L, G).</P>

	The wave front is a processual object, because it is a spatial
	distribution (at a certain moment, a temporal DP, an invariant Euler
	distribution) of a set of invariant properties of the propagation
	process (direction, velocity, contained energy etc.)</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">2</A>9
	Not only the energy contained in the wave front is preserved; within
	an isotropic medium (in which the propagation velocity does not
	depend on the direction), the shape of the wave front (its spatial
	distribution) preserves the radiator shape (obviously, with its
	sizes in proportion to the distance towards it).</P>
