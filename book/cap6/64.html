<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">6.4 Types of
distributed systems</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We have seen in section 5.2.2.3 that
the material fluxes, as collective conveyance processes of a set of
objects, can be divided in three basic classes S, L and G, according
to the type of the relations deployed between the inner spatial
references of the objects and the spatial global reference of the
set.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is worth reminding that these
relation types are:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>S-type relations</I>
	<I>-</I> If the relations between the inner T and R references of
	the constitutive objects are invariant during the motion, both
	between the proximity objects and against the homologue common T and
	R reference, the entire distribution of the amount <I>M </I>shall
	move just as a solid (rigid) body. In this case, there is a global
	(which is internal within the set) T and R reference with the
	positions defined against an external RS, and the variation of this
	position represents the overall motion of the set&rsquo;s spatial
	distribution. One may notice that within S-type relations, the inner
	free motions of the complex object&rsquo;s elements, either T or R,
	are forbidden.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>L-type relations</I>
	- If only the relations between the inner T<I> </I>references of the
	<U>neighbouring elements</U> are maintained invariant (the elements
	remain adjacent, permanently connected during the motion, but they
	are able to rotate freely), the entire distribution shall be moving
	just as a finite liquid quantity which preserves its volume, but it
	is not able to preserve its shape (inner distribution of the
	elements&rsquo;spatial position). In this case, there is only one
	common T reference (the mass-center for a liquid portion) whose
	motion against an outer T reference is the overall motion of the
	complex object.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>G-type relations</I>
	- If there is no invariant relation between the inner T and R
	references of the components and the common T and R reference of the
	distribution, those particular elements do not make-up a complex
	object any longer, each of these elements moving freely, just as the
	molecules of a gas. In case of G-type relations, any kind of inner
	motion is allowed and there is no interrelation between the T and R
	motions.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The possibility of
relative translation motions within the pairs of proximity elements,
as we are about to see later on, is strictly connected to the
temporal distribution of the interaction intensity. As for a DS whose
elements are permanently related (the inner spatial domains are
always adjacent), their <U>free</U> translation is excluded (there
are translation motions, but <U>they are not free</U> and are
generated as a result of the continuous action exerted by a system of
forces). The possibility of the rotation motions also depends (in
case of some permanent interactions) on the unevenness of the spatial
distribution of the interaction intensity <U>against the inner RS </U>of
each DS element. The uneven is the distribution (more anisotropic),
the less possible is the rotation of the elements one another. If
this distribution is even (isotropic), there are no favourite bonding
directions, and the elements will be able to rotate freely and
autonomously against their neighbors. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">According to these
specifications made in case of the distributed systems, two of the
criteria - <I>(an)isotropy </I>and<I> time distribution </I>of the
interaction intensity - allow their classification in the following
types:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="S_type_ds"></A><I>S-type

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">increased anisotropy of the

	changes produced in the elements position, both T and R). In case of
	this DS type, there are only S-type relations between its elements.</P>

	at the element level, or at the elements subset.</P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> interaction&rsquo;s intensity is
	isotropic (the parameters of the interaction generated by means of

	type of DS, only G-type relations occur between their elements.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">The non-permanent
interaction which is specific to G media allows the introduction of
the <I>free system </I>concept, considered to be the system whose
interactions with other systems are negligible (for certain periods
of time). This fact makes that the pathway covered during the time
when the system is isolated to be called <I>free pathway</I>. The
free pathway (or free path) notion is real only in case of this type
of medium (the volume restraint by means of compression is made only
based on the reduction of the free pathway and not through the
modification of the interaction intensity, resulting therefore the
high compressibility of these media).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">Few remarks
regarding the above-mentioned classification may be pointed out:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The systems with permanent
	interaction (S and L-types) do not allow the free inner translation,
	thus resulting their very low compressibility degree; the existence
	of this continuous interaction, inclusively for the elements placed
	at the system periphery makes that these DS to have a defined
	<I>bounding surface</I> (as area and form for S-type media and only
	as area for L-type media) against the outside medium, and
	accordingly, a proper defined volume.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The systems with an isotropic
	distribution of the interaction intensity against the inner R
	reference of the elements allow the elements rotation. As we are
	about to see on another occasion, the systems with anisotropic
	features of the interaction at a short distance are able to make-up
	an isotropic medium (or quasi-isotropic), if the conditions for the
	elements rotation are created (for example, by increasing the space
	between the elements over the working radius of the anisotropy, that
	is a situation which occurs, for instance, during the flow phase of
	the materials subjected to the stretching force, or as a result of
	the thermal dilatation).</P>

6.4.1: It is the moment to make a specification regarding the
<I>(an)isotropy</I> term. One aspect must be clearly understood: so
far, in this chapter, the discussion was only about the isotropy or
anisotropy of the spatial distribution of a single attribute, that
is: <U>the intensity of the bilateral interaction between the
elements of a DS</U> (in case of a NM, between its atoms or
molecules). We are not talking about the isotropy or anisotropy of
other properties, such as the mass density, refractive index, photon
transparency etc., all of these were mentioned because of an error
found in the technical papers, namely, the case of glass which is
also called &ldquo;undercooled and frozen liquids&rdquo;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP>2</SUP></A>5.
The fact that the above-mentioned macroscopic properties deploy an
isotropic distribution inside the glass, similarly with the liquids,
does not mean that <U>at the molecular level</U>, the distribution of
the interaction intensity between the glass molecules is not <U>highly
anisotropic</U> (with preferential bonding directions), by hindering
in this way the molecules rotation one to another, which gives the
non-deformable character of this material.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is important to notice that, within
the media which have a prohibited free translation, the translation
motion is however possible, not under a free form, but rather through
the modulation of the interaction intensity, that is the forced
translation (such as the vibratory one). The same thing is also valid
in case of the rotation motion.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The classification into S, L or G
systems is universal. As we are about to see further on, the category
of S-type of systems shall also include, besides solids, also the
bio-systems, artificial material systems, information support systems
(therefore, the abstract systems) etc. The category of L-type systems
may also include the media of the conduction electrons from metals,
the plasma structures (their ionized fraction), dry grained media
etc. Besides the non-ionized gases, the G-type systems also comprise
an extremely significant DS segment - which is represented by the
bio-populations (organismal media or the ones made-up from
independent cells) - in which the meaning of concepts such as &ldquo;free&rdquo;
and &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; remains the above-mentioned one.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As regards the
maintenance capacity of DS without additional external barriers
(which shall be analyzed later on in this paper), this time involving
the interaction sense, DS are divided in:</P>

	maintained in a liquid phase, at a specific temperature, only under

therefore self-maintained as long as they are alive), whereas the

made so far have taken into consideration that the elements of the

system&rsquo;s dissociation degree being in proportion to the number
of the decomposed elements as compared with the total number of the
elements belonging to the system (medium). This category comprises

individuals who are not joining to a family are also introduced, so

6.4.2: The &ldquo;dissociation&rdquo; term suggests the reverse
operation of the association, that is the breaking-out
(decomposition) of a system. Through dissociation, the system may
lose one or more of its elements (as compared to the complete model
configuration), until the entire decomposition of the system. The
currently used meaning for this word is limited to the description on
the dismemberment of some particular systems (such as the atoms,
molecules), but it can be also used for the decomposition of  other
systems which show charge attributes, such as the families of the
sexual bio-systems. In case of the dissociated systems, the
interaction of the fragments coming from the dissociated system is
much different than the one of the non-dissociated system. As we are
about to notice further on, this aspect is specific mainly to the
systems characterized by charge interaction. As a result of the
intensity and duration modification of the interactions, the
dissociation may lead to the modification of the medium type as
compared to a non-dissociated medium. For example, the ionized gases
(plasmas) are not G media any longer, because the interaction of the
ionized molecules is permanent (as long as the ionization lasts),
therefore, there is no free pathway except the one for the
non-ionized molecules.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">If the systems
which belong to a DS are all of the same kind, we may consider that
particular medium as a <I>pure</I> one. The purity concept is gradual
(measurable), rarely noticed at the abiotic media, but more frequent
at the biotic and artificial media.</P>

6.4.3: If according to the usual language, the <I>purity</I> concept
is mostly used in relation to the natural media (pure crystals,
liquids or gases etc.), this does not mean that it cannot be used for
the characterization of other media made-up from a single type of
elements. For example, a bacterial culture made-up from the division
of the same cell type under sterile conditions is genetically
speaking a pure medium (if no mutations are interfering). There is
also the term of ethnic purity for the social media.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
