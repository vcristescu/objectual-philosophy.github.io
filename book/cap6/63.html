<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">6.3 Centralized
and distributed systems</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">After reviewing the
classes of abiotic MS from the list from the paragr.1.1, by
considering the current knowledge level of the structure and of their
properties, we shall notice the existence of two major categories:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Systems with a relatively low
	number of elements, made-up from a subsystem placed in the system&rsquo;s
	central zone and many other satellite elements which are kept bound
	by the powerful interaction with the central subsystem;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Systems with a very large number
	of elements, made-up from systems with a similar organization level,
	where the interactions occur only between the proximity neighbors,
	these interactions having almost the same size grade of the
	intensity.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">From the point of
view of the interaction intensity distribution on the set of the
possible elements couple of the system, the systems from point <B>a
</B>are characterized by an increased unevenness of this
distribution. In this case, the interaction intensity with the
central subsystem is much more powerful than the intensity of the
interaction deployed between the satellite elements. This fact makes
that the effect of this central interaction to occur on all the
system&rsquo;s elements (working radius of the central element is
extended on all the MS elements). The systems which belong to this
type of organization are called <I>systems with central organization</I>,
in short, <I>centralized systems</I> (CS). AT or PS systems are
included (according to the list from par. 1.1), among others, in this
category.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in">As for the systems
from the point <B>b, </B>it is important that the interaction
intensity to have the same size grade on all its elements (the mean
value of this intensity per element has a saturation trend) and the
fact that the working radius of this interaction is limited only at
the proximity neighbors. Paradoxically, it is even this limited
working radius the one which allows the non-limited increase of these
types of MS by &ldquo;attaching&rdquo; new elements at the system&rsquo;s
boundaries, so that these systems to be able to have an extremely
large number of elements, and accordingly, extremely high spatial
dimensions. The systems with this kind of organization are named
<I>distributed systems</I> (DS).</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Comment
6.3.1: The &ldquo;distributed systems&rdquo; denomination is allowed
in the objectual philosophy  field due to the utilization of this
term into the scientific papers. In accordance to the paper herein,
any material system has a distribution of properties (including the
ones with a central organization), so that it is &ldquo;distributed&rdquo;
anyway. Objectually speaking, the correct term for the distributed
systems would be systems with an <I>even </I>distribution of the mean
interaction intensity.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="medium"></A>
If the number of elements which are allowed to enter into a
distributed system is that high so that the system&rsquo;s parameters
can be statistically estimated (the laws of large numbers are valid)
and propagation processes may occur (which shall be approached later
on), this kind of distributed system is called <I><B>medium</B></I>.
For example, NM systems belong to this category. This type of
material system (DS) hosts many type of fluxes, mostly of the
propagation ones, that is the reason why we are continuing with DS
classification.</P>
